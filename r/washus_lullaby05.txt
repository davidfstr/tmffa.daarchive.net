=========================================================================



Washu strode boldly across the stage, the oversized lecture robes that 
hung draped over her diminutive frame dragging behind her, causing tiny 
clouds of dust to appear. Pacing beyond the podium, she folded her arms 
behind her back and peered over the vast auditorium through tiny lenses 
that were perched at the end of her nose. She said, "I suppose you're all 
wondering why I called you here?"

The current occupancy of the room was three, including Washu. In the 
front row, Naja groaned. "You know, Washu, I think you may have finally 
begun to try my patience."

Washu clicked her tongue. "Then we're finally beginning to even things 
up! I remember when you had no patience to try."

"That was a lifetime ago," Naja said shortly. "People change." It was a 
pointed comment, but Washu brushed it away.

"Some people do not change," she returned, jabbing a pointer-stick at the 
room's other occupant. In the second row, across the aisle from Naja, 
Dr. Clay sat tightly. "You! You're the same rude, overweight, pompous ass 
you've always been."

"And?" he growled.

"Only now you're a <powerful> rude overweight pompous ass. They tell me 
you're next in line for the Director's chair when Ikuma retires next 
month."

Clay smirked. "And just what do you intend to do about that, may I ask, 
dear Washu?"

Washu grinned back. "May I respond, dear Clay, that I intend to run 
against you."

Her self-satisfied expression faded as Clay began to roar with laughter. 
The sound echoed off the walls, multiplying. "You! Against me! Oh that's 
rich, Washu, that really is too much." He wiped his eyes. "While you've 
been making a public spectacle of yourself, I've been building a power 
base. You may be popular, but that will never get you the Director's 
chair!"

Naja rose. "He's right, Washu. Four weeks you sit holed up in your lab, 
only coming out to raid the cooler, and now you call me away from my work 
for this? This is a waste of time."

Washu sniffed. "How little you must think of me."

Clay stood smugly. "At last you understand. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm 
tired of humoring you. I need to put the finishing touches on the 
Academy's latest positronic network."

With a theatrical flourish, Clay tossed back his cape and marched down 
the center aisle towards the rear exit. When he had gone, Naja walked up 
onto the stage. Washu had hopped atop the small podium and slung her legs 
across the front, and was scowling into space. "Would you look at that? 
I'm smarter than all the Academy heads combined! Who does he think he 
is?"

Naja frowned. "Who do you think <you> are?"

"I'm the greatest scientific genius in the universe. How about you?"

"I'm your friend."

"I know."

"And I'll thank you not to invite me to any more private meetings with 
that squat, overstuffed toad."

Washu laughed. "Just imagine how you'll be able to rub it in his face 
when he has to report to me."

Naja half-smiled. "You intend to go through with this?"

Washu snapped backwards and did a somersault onto the stage. "Absolutely."

Naja raised an eyebrow. "Very dexterous of you. What makes you think 
Ikuma will back you?"

"He owes me," Washu said darkly.

Naja shook her head. "Not enough. Too many people owe Clay. You'll have 
to do better."

"I'll find a way. He's replaceable."

"He's also dependable," Naja cautioned. "Your behavior has been ... 
erratic, to say the least."

Washu crossed her arms. "Then I'll just have to make myself 
indispensable."

"How are you going to do that? By being 'cute?' "

Washu waved a dismissive hand. "Don't bother me with details!"

Naja sighed and sat down on the end of the stage. "Fine. Since you're not 
busy with details, a message came for you from home. Intersystem Express. 
It sounded important."

"Did Mikoto let the animals loose again? Why would they use Intersystem 
..." she trailed off. "Oh ... <home>."

                                 * * *

The light was fading when Washu arrived at Kanemitsu, and she pulled her 
dark cloak tight against the evening chill. It was autumn at the 
monastery. The sky was overcast, a mottled gray. The trees were barren 
and dry, and did not muffle the distant sound of the chapel bells calling 
adherents to prayer.

Washu lowered herself from the cart on which she had hitched a ride and 
thanked the farmer for his trouble when he refused her fee. As he rode 
off on his beast of burden, Washu looked around. The layout was much as 
it was years ago when she had left. Then there had been crowds of people, 
filling the landscape, eager to say their farewells. Now the dusty trails 
were empty -- most of the sisters would be indoors at this time. The 
children at the orphanage would have already been gathered for the 
evening meal. For a moment, staring across the empty paths, she had a 
flashback to an earlier time. She saw herself as a girl, sitting alone 
beneath a tree, playing with stones while the other children laughed and 
chased each other. Had she known what she was missing? The moment passed 
as an icy breeze grazed her skin.

Hitching her cloak around her shoulders, she began the walk to the 
rectory. She did not look at the infirmary as she passed it. According to 
the message she had received, it was past time for that. The Reverend 
Mother would be resting comfortably in bed during her final hours.

Honora met Washu at the rectory's front door. She was puzzled at first by 
Washu's diminutive form, but once she recognized the face beneath the 
hood, she drew her former charge into an enveloping embrace. Tears 
streamed down her round face. "Washu ... little Washu!"

Washu returned the embrace somewhat stiffly. "How is she?"

Honora wiped her face. "The gods are merciful. You're just in time. 

"How much time?" Washu asked softly.

"Hours. Maybe minutes. Oh, Washu, she wanted so badly to see you. I 
mustn't take up any more time. Come this way. Let me take your cloak."

The bedroom was virtually barren: a flat bed and a wooden nightstand that 
held a single candle. One small round window captured the light of the 
dying sun. A draft caused the candle flame to flicker, casting smoky 
shadows on the adobe wall. A short stool sat by the bedside. It was 
exactly as Washu remembered it -- with one exception. The Reverend Mother 
had forsaken worldly pleasures. Her bed had always been flat and hard. 
Now it was covered with blankets and cushions to support old bones and 
protect against the chill. Washu's throat knotted up as she saw the 
slight figure within the covers. The Reverend Mother had been a stocky 
woman, but the form beneath the bed-sheets was clearly emaciated. Washu 
swallowed. The old woman looked like a child, except for her face. Her 
eyes were open, but they stared at nothing, the lids fluttering 
constantly. Lines of age and wisdom hung slack across the bones of her 
face. As Washu and Honora entered, she stirred.

"Honora ..." Her voice was faint and raspy.

Honora stepped forward. "Washu is here, Reverend Mother."

Ancient lips spasmed into a tiny smile. The wizened face managed to 
radiate delight. A trembling hand moved out from beneath the sheet. 
"Leave us. Let me talk to my daughter alone."

Honora bowed, pulled out the stool for Washu, then left. Washu sat down 
uncomfortably. Her mind seemed to be far from her body.

Making an effort, the Reverend Mother turned her head to face Washu. 
"Come closer, child. Let me look at you." The skin around her eyes 
tightened. "Washu!" Washu flinched involuntarily at the stern disapproval 
in the dying woman's voice. "Have some respect. Wear your proper age in 
my presence."

Washu nodded and it was done.

The Reverend Mother grunted her approval and shifted her shoulders. "How 
is your child? And your husband? Most of the news is censored here, and 
the sisters refuse to tell me gossip."

Washu swallowed. "They're ... fine."

The old woman smiled. "I would know if you were lying. I'm surprised you 
didn't bring them. Legal issues, I assume."

"Yes," Washu mumbled. "Legal issues."

"But you, child ... you do not seem fine. What troubles you?"

"I can't hide anything from you. But please ... don't let my problems 
interfere with your ..." she trailed off, choked.

"Then for my sake, let me perform this last service to you. It will weigh 
favorably on my soul."

Washu's lip trembled. "Reverend Mother ... why must you die?"

The old woman closed her eyes. "It is the way of things."

"But why now? I could have the best doctors at the Academy here in hours. 
They can help you! Make you better!"

The Reverend Mother shook her head. "It's too late for that now. I have 
lived a long life. Longer than most. You do not need me anymore, sweet 
Washu. Remember your teaching and go on with your life."

Washu bowed her head. "You're the only family I have," she whispered.

The Reverend Mother looked up in surprise. Her eyes became filled with 
sorrow. "Can it be true?" She exhaled a shaky breath. When she spoke, it 
was with a kind of urgency. "Daughter. Last night I had a vision. You 
stood among the stars, wearing robes of purple and gold. On each shoulder 
was inset a blazing emerald eye, and you had wings like an angel. Three 
green circles were burned across your forehead, and in your hands you 
held three glowing lights. I reached out to touch you ... to let you know 
you were not alone. But you vanished, and then I awoke."

"What can it mean?" asked Washu.

The old woman struggled to inhale. "Sometimes a dream is only a dream. 
The details were vivid enough to make me suspicious. But what struck me 
as undeniably significant were my own feelings ... my desire to touch 
you." She reached up to stroke Washu's cheek. Her eyes were lucid with 
the clarity that only comes with dying. "Remember our love for you. 
Someday you will learn ..."

The hand slid down her cheek and fell at the bedside. Washu looked 
through widening eyes at the limp figure. "Reverend Mother?" But there 
was no response. Washu sat silently, and after a while Honora came in. 
Washu left without a word.

Outside, she walked through the Reverend Mother's private garden. It was 
empty now, of all but barren wood. She stopped by a large tree in the 
center, bending over to touch with one hand a raised mound on the ground 
between two roots: a secret monument to something that had once been 
vibrant and alive. For the second time in her life, she cried.

                                 * * *

For several seconds, Naja ignored the comm alert. The numbers on the 
screen were more important. But almost immediately, the two data strings, 
on which she had worked so long and so hard, failed and fell apart. 
Biting off a curse, she answered the call. "Who is it?"

The face of a male student appeared on her screen. The badge on his 
shoulder marked him as an employee of the Transit Authority. "Professor 
Naja, Dr. Hakubi's shuttle just arrived."

Naja inclined her head. "Thank you, Tori."

The young man bowed. "If I may ask, Ms. Naja ... why was it so important 
that I contact you immediately? I could get in trouble with my 
supervisor!"

Naja smiled. "I'd have it taken care of. In answer to your question, I 
need the advance warning to lock up my private data. You'd be surprised 
how fast she ..."

"Keeping secrets again, Naja?"

Naja spun around on her floating bench. Washu grinned smugly in the door-
way. Naja sighed and shut down her computer. "I don't even want to know 
how you got here so fast."

"Good, 'cause I'm not telling! Now put away your gene grafting ..." Naja 
made a noise of indignation. "... or whatever it is and listen to this. I 
had an epiphany!"

Naja stood, putting her hands on her hips. "Don't I want to know how the 
funeral went? How you're feeling?"

Washu waved her back. "It's in the past. This is the future. I've figured 
out how to make myself too valuable to ignore in my bid for the 
Director's chair."

"Enlighten me."

"Remember our little hack job? The top-secret bio-engineering of Imperial 
Jurai?"

Naja paled. "Washu, this room isn't secure ..."

"To hell with security! I'm telling them!"

"What?" Naja sat down heavily. "You're out of your mind!"

Washu casually examined the back of her hand. "Such a big, ultra super-
duper science project assuredly has the best minds in the galaxy working 
on it." She leapt up. "Except one!"

Naja held her head in her hands. "Damn you, Washu! You'll get us both 
thrown out! Or executed! Or worse!"

But Washu only winked. "Why kill me when they can hire me?" Naja fell 
sideways onto her bench with a small moan. "And by the way," Washu 
continued, "invert your tertiary metachromotic sequences and your numbers 
should fit." She ducked a boot on her way out the door.

                                 * * *

Tatsuki Nishia Jurai reclined in his high-backed chair. A silver headband 
pulled blue-black hair away from his forehead. He gazed across the desk, 
face dominated by steely eyes and the strong jaw of Jurai nobility. "It's 
a pleasure to see you again, Lady Washu." His eyes glinted with humor. 
"You don't look a day older than when we last met."

Washu set down her tea and laughed gracefully. "Why Lord Nishia! Flirting 
with a girl my age! What would your mother think?" His face went 
awkwardly slack. "Don't worry, I'm not here for extortion," she lied. 
Privately, she smiled. As if she had any interest in the man. Years ago, 
perhaps she might have seen something appealing. <But time brings all 
wounds.> House Tatsuki had a seat on the Jurai Supreme Council, and it 
was the Council that stood in her way.

Nishia leaned forward pleasantly. "I've heard about your bid for the 
Director's chair. I presume you're here because the chair can only be 
granted by royal appointment. Unfortunately, my family has already 
pledged their support to Dr. Clay. You know how these things work. 
Personally, I'd love to support you. I saved your life after all." He 
smiled.

Washu narrowed her eyes at his tone. It seemed to invoke a reminder of 
where debts were owed. <He has no idea who owes whom what.> "Clay is 
nothing," she said confidently. "Flotsam."

Nishia shook his head. "Don't underestimate Dr. Clay, Lady Washu. He has 
much to offer."

"Compared to what I can do for you, he's got nothing."

A sarcastic smile appeared on Nishia's face. "And what are you offering, 
precisely?"

She leaned forward eagerly until her face was inches from his. She could 
hear his nervous swallow. "Haven't you heard? My most recent field of 
expertise is bio-enforcement."

He released a small laugh. "We have no outstanding bio-enforcement 
projects. Even if we did, we'd have no use for you."

"Oh?" she said. Her tone was too innocent, and her eyes sparkled with 
delicious malice as he frowned. She regarded the desk as if distracted. 
"You know, I've been thinking a lot about the past. I remembered some-
thing ... a name you mentioned at our last encounter. Why don't we talk 
about ..." Her head swept up, eyes locking with his. "Tsunami."

Nishia became absolutely still. He stared at her for several seconds. 
When he spoke, it was a deadly, measured tone. "You do not know of what 
you speak."

Washu kicked up her feet onto the desk. "Oh, I think I do. Everyone knows 
the stories." Her voice became theatrical. "Tsunami: Primogenitor of 
Jurai -- the wave that will carry Jurai into a new era of power and 
prosperity! Something like that."

He paled. "How did you make the connection ... All records were deleted!"

She winked. "You forgot to burn the hardcopies." His face twitched. "Face 
it. You need my help. You know, I wondered why Ikuma was retiring so 
early."

Nishia colored. "Professor Ikuma has had a long and distinguished career 
of service ..."

"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't bore me. I know Ikuma. He loves his work. To 
him, life literally is work. Which means he wouldn't leave it behind if 
it was in his power. At the very least, you'd expect to see some change 
in his behavior. Which I haven't. So I figure his 'retirement' is just a 
public front to give him more time to work on the Tsunami project." 

Nishia gaped. 

She continued. "And that's not all. He's obviously been working with you 
for years without slowing down his duties as the Academic Director. If he 
needs more time for Tsunami, it means something about the project has 
changed. You're moving into the next phase, and I'd wager it's not going 
as smoothly as you've hoped."

"There have been problems," he muttered.

"Exactly as I thought. Given the nature of the project, I imagine you're 
having trouble getting the forces you've been tampering with under proper 
control.

Nishia slammed a fist onto the surface of the desk. "By all that is holy! 
How can you possibly know so much? We had the best protection!"

"I'm a super-genius, remember? Besides, this is elementary logic. For my 
final deduction, your bafflement suggests that you haven't had much 
experience with intellects of my caliber, which in turn implies that you 
don't have anyone on my level working for you." She leaned forward. "I'm 
prepared to put my mind to work for you. All I ask is the Academy chair. 
A small price to pay to secure Jurai's share in the future galactic 
hegemony."

As she had spoken, Nishia had grown less indignant and more reflective. 
Now he steepled his fingers and looked at her carefully. "First of all, I 
want you to realize that this is not a matter to be taken lightly. People 
have been killed for knowing too much on this subject. Even you, Washu, 
are expendable, though I hate to put it that way." He paused for effect. 
"That said, your proposition is an interesting one. If you make good on 
your claims, you could potentially save us months, if not years, of 
research. It would also let us avoid bringing Clay into our inner circle. 
He may be useful, but no one is entirely comfortable trusting him with 
this kind of data." He pursed his lips thoughtfully. "Would you consent 
to a small trial?"

Washu stared back indifferently. "What sort of trial?"

"I'd have to consult with the Council, of course, but ... As you've 
probably guessed, the complications are taking place at the source: the 
royal trees. If you are truly as well-suited for the job as you claim, 
the trees will detect it. The deeper you go, the more selective the trees 
become. The first-generation grove is where we're having difficulty 
making progress. If you qualify and gain access to that level, and can 
demonstrate your usefulness, I imagine the Council will be willing to 
bring you aboard with only a few reservations for security purposes. If 
this should come to pass, I think it's a safe bet that the Director's 
chair would be yours for the asking. If not ... well, you take your 
chances with their judgment."

Washu tapped her fingers against the arm of her chair, considering the 
offer. <The responsible thing to do would be to carefully weigh all the 
pros and cons of such an important decision. On the other hand, I already 
know what I want.> She smiled. "You've got yourself a deal."

                                 * * *

"You know," Washu told the magistrate as they walked across the long 
hall, "this is my first time on planet Jurai. I must say I'm impressed." 

The magistrate only sniffed. He was a tall man, with silver hair that was 
whiter than Naja's, and a hawk-like nose that was probably characteristic 
of his particular royal house. Washu sized him up as they walked. "I can 
see you're a real conversationalist."

He looked at her with dour eyes. "We have little time for levity here at 
Block 194. Our task is to keep access to the royal trees secure." He 
frowned. "Normally, that would include escorting you out of here."

She smiled widely. "Good thing I'm a member of the team, huh?"

"Not just yet," he said quietly.

"Hmph." She folded her arms. "You don't like me, do you?"

He sighed. "I find it hard to imagine you directing the Science Academy, 
let alone contributing to the Tsunami project."

Washu blushed. "It's my girlish figure, isn't it?" 

He scowled. "When I look at the Academy Director, I look for stability. 
It would make me more comfortable if your appearance matched your age."

"Well I like this body. And hey! You should be grateful! This way, no one 
will suspect you of sleeping with me!" His eyes widened and she 
sniggered. He opened his mouth to speak, but she cut him off. "So how 
deep, exactly, does Tsunami go?"

The magistrate closed his mouth and his eyes bored into her. "The Tsunami 
Unit penetrates to the very heart of the original royal tree."

"I see. Did the tree's power create the Tsunami Unit, or was it the other 
way around?"

"You misunderstand. The benevolent goddess legend is all well and good 
for the layman. But the reality of the situation is that Tsunami is a 
Jurai invention. A staggeringly complex method of genetic programming 
that serves as a kind of conduit to the power inherent in the trees. A 
kind of mental operating system. We created it, through many thousands of 
years of hard work."

Washu raised an eyebrow. "You're so sure?"

"Of course. What other possibility is there? Artificial consciousness 
does not simply materialize out of random energies. It must be carefully 
nurtured ..."

She cut him off. "And you can quantify your theory?"

His frown deepened. "It is not a theory."

"Then you have data to back it up?"

"The process is ... very complex ..."

"You haven't gotten anything useful at all, have you?"

His face turned a darker shade of ash. "No. But we will," he added 
hastily. "We thought you might be of some help in that regard. The next 
generation of Jurai battleships must be factors greater in magnitude if 
we hope to secure the future."

Washu made a skeptical noise. "We're almost there."

"Yes," he said.

The hallway was coming to an end. It was a wide and very tall corridor, 
decorated on both sides with wide aureate structures that held 
luminescent plants. A double-row of blue spheres hung from the ceiling. 
Along both sides of the floor were huge wooden bases, cylindrical in 
shape, that supported an abundance of vegetation. The Juraian culture was 
firmly based in plant life. The royal palace itself was one enormous tree 
-- developed over the centuries from the original first-generation source. 
The hallway led to that structure's vast interior space, the walls 
stopping at a pair of massive blue doors which were covered with an 
intricate framework of golden harvest carvings.

"You are very lucky," the magistrate said, indicating the doors. 
"Typically, only those of royal blood are allowed to venture beyond this 
point." From behind there was the hard rhythm of footsteps, and he 
turned. "Here is Lord Nishia."

Nishia nodded curtly as he approached. "Are we ready to begin, then?" 
Washu bowed assent. "Very well. Let’s go in." He placed one hand against 
the center of the doors and pushed gently. They swung inward smoothly, 
leaving just enough space between them to enter comfortably. Washu looked 
behind her. There was no one else in the hall. A sense of pleasurable 
excitement filled her, and she walked through the doors.

She stepped into a wonderland. In spite of herself, she felt a serious 
measure of awe. She was accustomed to grandeur, of course. The mysteries 
of astral bodies, dimensional fields and natural science had all been 
laid bare before her. But nothing had quite prepared her for the sight of 
the royal groves.

The interior of the structure was cavernous, towering higher than 
ordinary vision could detect. In breadth, it was wider than any structure 
in the Academy's philosophy department. Suspended in the air were count-
less free-floating alabaster islands of various graceful shapes and 
sizes, each of which supported a tree. A few islands were connected by 
long organic bridges, but most were unfettered. The surface of each 
island contained a shallow pool of blue light which Washu presumed 
functioned as a transmitter of some kind. There was one on the narrow 
balcony on which she now stood. She took a deep breath. The room was 
alive with energy, she could sense it. Occasionally, a shimmering strand 
of pure energy would crackle through the air, streaming from one tree to 
another.

"The network," she said.

Nishia beamed proudly. "All our work, bless the goddess." He pointed to a 
far-off tree. "That is mine."

"You're not a blood member of the royal family," she said.

Nishia nodded. "No, so my access is only so great. But I am of Jurai. 
That particular tree chose me."

"I wondered how that worked." Washu stepped forward to the end of the 
balcony, next to the light pool, and peered over the rim. Beneath her 
hung many more islands, sinking ever further into the abyss. The level 
she was on was well-lit by the distant sun, but the deeper she looked, 
the darker the shaft seemed to become, dissolving into a murky and 
indistinct void. She could not see the bottom. "I’d hate to take that 
fall," she commented. "Is that where we have to go?"

"That is the heart of the system," Nishia said. "Whether you get that far
is another matter."

"Don’t the transmitters go down that far?" she asked.

The magistrate leaned forward. "All transmitters are functional, for the 
right person." His tone implied that this fact disqualified her.

Washu placed a hand on the back of her neck. "I suppose it’s no good 
taking a lift down."

Nishia shook his head. "Security systems. You’d fall to your death."

Washu shrugged. "Oh well," she said, and immediately stepped onto the 
blue transmitter pad.

"Wait!" cried the magistrate, "You haven’t been properly instructed!" He 
grabbed at her arm, but she dissolved into a matrix of shimmering energy 
and vanished. His hand passed through empty air. "Foolish girl!" he 
growled, then stepped after her. Nishia shook his head and followed.

The pair of them materialized several levels down. Washu was not with 
them. The magistrate looked around angrily. They were surrounded by empty 
islands. "Like as not, she’s gotten herself lost."

Nishia looked over the island’s rim and stared down into the darkness. "I 
don’t think so."

                                 * * *

It was dim, but there was light, a deep, midnight-blue, and Washu’s large 
green eyes adjusted quickly. She was standing at the bottom of the well 
-- there was water all around her, dark, and rich with vegetation. She 
was standing on a small island about a meter-and-a-half across. Directly 
ahead of her, across the water, was a surprisingly small tree -- almost a 
sapling compared to some of the giants she had seen. But the size was 
deceptive if the power emanating from and around it was any indication. 
As she watched, silken strands of light struck out from seemingly random 
points on the tree to strike the placid liquid, where concentric rings of 
light and color formed.

"So this is the heart of the system," Washu whispered. "Tsunami." An 
oddly familiar sensation washed over her, and the roots of her hair 
tingled in anticipation. She made a motion with her hand and a data 
screen opened in the air before her. "Well, let’s get to work."

She began to type. Hours passed in silence.

At last she stopped. "You're aware of me, aren’t you?" she asked aloud.

There was another moment of silence, then a soft, whispery voice that 
seemed to come from everywhere answered, "Yes."

Washu smiled. "I thought so."

The voice spoke again. It was gentle and unmistakably feminine. "We have 
been aware of you for some time."

Washu raised an eyebrow, unsure what to think. "Is that so? You mean the 
time I’ve been down here, of course." There was no response. Washu rubbed 
at her nose, then shrugged. "You are Tsunami?"

The voice replied, but slowly. "I ... am ... Tsunami."

Washu placed her hands on her hips. "Hmm. They really don’t know what 
they’ve got here. I haven’t encountered this sort of high-level 
dimensional feedback since ..." Dipping into a pocket, she pulled out her 
gem pendant. The stones within seemed to pulse with light, and the beams 
of energy coming from the tree sang out sympathetically. "Interesting 
reaction," Washu whispered to herself. She looked at the tree. "The Jurai 
didn’t create you, did they? Even thousands of years ago?" Silence. "So 
where did you come from, anyway?"

"I ... have been waiting." The tree seemed to glow. "I have been ... 
looking."

"At something or for something?" Again, there was no reply. Washu sighed. 
If there were answers here, they were closed to her for the time being. 
"Well ... whatever you are, wherever you came from, you’re definitely not 
a product of the system. According to this data, you’re not even entirely 
inside it. That’s why the Jurai can’t control you. But it also limits 
your access. The further you extend yourself through subsequent 
generations of trees, the weaker you become." She chewed softly on her 
lip.

"All of the Jurai bio-enforcement has been on the human end. Royal trees 
can't be grafted, only grown. That's their problem. But for some reason, 
your dimensional signature is sympathetic to the energy of my gems. I can 
nudge things in the right direction. It would give you a greater ability 
to manifest your powers, but you’d be fully enclosed within the system 
the Jurai have established. They might even be able to contain you 
permanently, even if they could never duplicate you."

"The Jurai king would not abuse me," the voice whispered. "We are 
friends. We have made ... promises."

Washu blinked. That was a surprise, even if it made no sense. "That may 
be true, for now. But there may come a day when that changes. Unless you 
can see the future." There was a silence and Washu narrowed her eyes. She 
crossed her arms. "Well anyway, I won't do it without your permission. 
Besides, I'm not entirely comfortable myself, handing the Jurai such 
power."

"Do what you must." The voice was fading, barely audible.

Washu took a deep breath and poised her fingers on the keypad. <I know 
what I want.> She began to type. "Here we go. This may sting a little."

                                 * * *

"Whaddaya <mean> you'll think about it?!" Washu cried. "We had a deal!"

The magistrate smiled at her across his desk. "You can't expect us to be 
completely unreasonable. There are politics to consider. Obligations." 
Washu looked angrily at Nishia, who only shrugged. "You should be 
grateful you've been nominated at all," the magistrate continued in a 
magniloquent tone. "Isn't that enough?"

"No, that's not enough! I thought we had an understanding."

He rose from his chair. "The only understanding is that you will submit 
your presentation video to the Supreme Council tomorrow. Good day, Dr. 
Hakubi."

Washu skipped the customary formalities, leaving the magistrate with a 
gesture that made his eyes bulge in righteous shock. Naja was waiting for 
her outside, wearing a hat and carrying party favors. Her broad smile 
died as she met Washu's gaze. "That bad?"

"I give them everything they've ever wanted on a platter and they show me 
the door!"

Naja's face fell. "You mean ..."

"No, no, I'll be nominated. But I'll still have to compete against Clay."

"Oh." Naja considered this. "Well, cheer up! I'm sure your project will 
make the better impression."

At that, Washu half-smiled. "You may be right."

                                 * * *

The following morning, Naja found herself frantically scouting the top of 
the crowd for any sign of Washu. She was standing near the rear of the 
now-filled auditorium. Most of the occupants were students, with a large 
portion of the civilian population represented. The first few rows were 
held by the more important citizens and politicians, as well as 
representatives from various student organizations. There was a pit just 
beneath the stage for members of the media, who were broadcasting the 
event live. The Supreme Council had convened on the stage itself, facing 
an enormous floating screen upon which the two candidates would project 
their presentation videos. Clay occupied one of the four chairs, sitting 
next to his comparatively diminutive assistant. The other two chairs were 
empty.

"Washu!" Naja hissed to herself. "Where are you? They're about to begin!"

"I'm right here."

Naja turned to find Washu beaming up at her. "Not funny, Washu-chan! 
Where have you been?"

Washu seized her arm and began walking cheerily towards the stage. The 
crowd filling the aisle parted with a reverent buzz. "I had a few things 
to take care of," she whispered.

Naja gave a skeptical grunt. "You're certainly in a good mood. Why the 
sudden show of confidence?"

Washu winked. "I'm the greatest scientific genius in the universe, 
remember?" Before Naja could respond, they had reached the stage. No 
sooner had Naja taken her seat, than the lights dimmed and the screen lit 
up.

"My video is first," Washu whispered.

Naja watched in silence, unsure why Washu had bothered with an assistant 
at all. She'd had no part in putting together the presentation. It was on 
one of Washu's research studies on microbiotic civilizations. Naja had 
heard the material before, and she actually found herself growing bored. 
"Couldn't you have come up with something more interesting than this?" 
she said under her breath.

"Just wait," Washu said.

As the projected image of Washu launched into her conclusion, Clay, 
sitting a few feet away, was smiling to himself. <If this is the best 
Washu can do, I've already won!> The image on the screen faded and there 
was a slight smattering of applause. <They're impressed, but she's failed 
to win them over!> Puffing his chest out, Clay swaggered to the center of 
the stage, bowed before the Council, and gave the signal to begin his 
video.

It wasn't until he returned to his seat that Clay noticed that the 
presentation had begun without the musical fanfare and opening monologue 
he had recorded. He looked up at the screen. It seemed to be some sort of 
hospital scene. Perhaps the video had accidentally jumped ahead. That 
would be a pity ... but the initial narration was probably dispensable. 
Most of the students were already familiar with his work in studying the 
effects of long-term dimensional stasis on brain tissue. He leaned over 
to his assistant. "Did we include any actual medical footage?" The 
assistant only stared at the gigantic screen, where an unusually buxom 
nurse had appeared. Clay frowned. What was she doing? How had this 
useless footage managed to find its way into his thesis? And the music! 
It was painfully cheap, hardly befitting an educational program. He 
squinted. There was something very familiar about that uniform ...

By the time he remembered, the nurse was half-done unbuttoning her top. 
Five seconds later, all hell broke loose.

                                 * * *

"So," Washu said, kicking back on a floating cushion in her laboratory. 
She sipped her drink and smiled at Naja. "Did you catch old octopus-
head's reaction when the princess fainted?"

>From where she was sitting, Naja grinned. "I have to hand it to you ... 
I've never seen a man turn so white!" The pair giggled, then toasted each 
other.

"Poor Clay," Washu said. "I almost feel sorry for him. I guess he'll just 
have to enjoy the graduate college for a while. They're all a bunch of 
weirdoes anyway. I'm sure he'll take whatever special appointments he can 
get."

Naja idly sloshed the liquid in her glass. "And what about you, Madam 
Director? How does Jurai figure in to your future?"

Washu smirked. "Jurai and the Science Academy are closely linked. It's a 
centuries-old tradition. It may take centuries to break."

"And what of the power you've just handed them?"

"Nishia wasn't telling the whole truth. What I did was a challenge, but 
it seemed almost too easy. Maybe the Jurai were further along than they 
wanted me to believe. Maybe Tsunami allowed it to happen. Maybe both. You 
want to know what I think?" Naja nodded. "I think there's something else 
going on. You know what?" Naja shook her head. "I don't care. I got what 
I wanted. Now take a look at my latest project." Washu hopped off the 
cushion and set down her glass. Walking over to Naja, she pulled the gem 
pendant from around her neck, unfastened the clasp and let the three 
ruby-red orbs roll into her palm.

Naja leaned forward for a closer look. "Your heirlooms?"

"More than that. Here, take them." She dropped the jewels into Naja's 
cupped hands. "Probe them."

Naja closed her eyes, then gasped in surprise. "Such power! I never 
knew!"

Washu nodded. "Now try to access it."

Naja's jaw tightened in concentration. Suddenly her eyes flashed open and 
she emitted a small cry of pain. From her hands, there was a brilliant 
explosion of light. When Washu's vision returned to normal, Naja was 
sprawled several meters away, one hand on her head, one smoking hand 
stiffly cradling the gems. "Washu!" she gasped. "You might have warned 
me!"

Washu hopped over to help her friend up. "I wasn't sure myself what the 
reaction would be."

Naja struggled to her feet, thrusting her clenched hand at Washu. "Here! 
Take them!" She leaned against a wooden railing to regain her balance and 
took a deep breath. Her eyes met Washu's. "Where did you get those?"

Washu shrugged. "They've been with me since I was a little girl. You know 
I have no memory of my life before Kanemitsu."

"Do you have access to that power?"

Washu frowned. "Yes. After a fashion. It seems to respond to my genetic 
signature in much the same way the royal trees respond to the power of 
Tsunami. But like the trees, something is blocking me from complete 
access through a direct connection."

Naja's eyes blazed with concentration. "Then perhaps there is a way. Have 
you considered the Jurai solution?"

Washu shook her head. "You can't plant people. And I'm not going to clone 
myself."

"No, no!" Naja said emphatically, "A clone wouldn't work, anyway."

Washu raised an eyebrow. "You've looked into this?"

Naja nodded. "The conundrum relates to my magnum thesis. A simple clone 
would have the same limitations. You'd need to introduce an entirely new 
element. Such a procedure would be highly experimental. It might take 
ages to get it to work, but all my research points to the conclusion that 
it's possible."

Washu stroked her chin thoughtfully. "Introducing a new element to my 
genetic structure would be tricky. It would have to be more than merely 
compatible, first of all. It would need to be adaptive, and able to 
channel great energies. Anything with that potential would be volatile." 
She looked at Naja. "Did your research turn up anything like that?"

Naja shook her head sadly. "Not on the scale we're talking about. But I 
have some idea of where to start looking. Why don't you examine the data 
yourself?"

A dimensional pocket opened up between them and a neatly bound stack of 
papers emerged. "You have been busy!" Washu said appreciatively.

Naja gave her a sardonic look. "I do more with my time than back you up."

Washu took the book in her hands and read the word on the cover.

"Kagato."

Naja's eyes sparked with fierce intensity. "It means 'like a god' ..."
