More Than a Creator

Ryoko sat quietly staring blankly at the trees across the lake.  She had
been sitting in this tree for the last hour or so thinking about the day
Washuu told her she was her mother and painfully recalling that night
events.
 "He told me to get off of him.  And I know he really wanted me to, but did
he have to say that."  She whispered to herself.
The wind seemed to feel Ryoko's pain and a gentle breeze blew on her back
and played with her hair.  "You took it harder then any of us thought you
would."  Came a voice from the ground.  Ryoko had never heard this voice
before.  She looked at the ground prepared to blast anyone she saw.
The only person she saw was Washuu.  However, it was Washuu as they had
only seen her on rare occasions.  She was in adult form.  "He only said that

because he thought everyone knew.  It still came as a shock to Mihoshi of
course."  Washuu said in a comforting tone and appeared next to her
daughter.
"Well, I didn't.  You could've told me."  Ryoko shot Washuu a glare.

"I didn't tell you because a mother has to let her daughter figure out
some
things."

"You're not my mother!  Just leave me alone!"

"I know you don't want me to leave.  Tell me the way you see things."

Ryoko gave Washuu a puzzled look.  She saw that Washuu was trying to be
the mother she was.  Ryoko took a deep breath and began.  "All my life I
hadn't had any family.  When I crashed on Earth I decided that Tenchi's
family would be my family.  I thought that I crashed because it was meant to

be.  Tenchi and me forever.
"I was happy.  Mihoshi seemed to be to busy trying to be rescued to want
Tenchi.  So, everything was just wonderful.  Then, she had to land here,"
Ryoko got a look of disgust across her face.  "Tenchi took her out for the
day, after she was convinced she needed a vacation.  I was still happy
though.  She would only be here a day and I knew she was to proper to try
anything while she was out with Tenchi.
"Then I had to go and blow my happiness away.  When I crashed Ayeka's
ship I should've known it was the beginning of the end.  I was fine, for
the
first few days.  Then Ayeka and Tenchi got to know each other better.  It
was
horrible.  Sasami's cooking was a large improvement though. I would still
find ways to get Tenchi alone.
"Then, we fought Kagato.  You told me you created me.  You realized that
this was your chance to have a second chance with a child and claimed to be
my mother.  I was okay with that.  I still had Tenchi so everything was
fine.
 Until tonight.  Tonight, I was simply trying to get him alone to tell him
how I felt.  I suppose I did come on to aggressive.  But, that's the only
nature I've ever known.
"There was no one around my whole life to teach me otherwise.  I
should've listened to him the first time he told me to get off.  But, I
didn't and he yelled at me.  Ayeka watched.  I could tell she wanted to
get
me off of him.  But she knew that she wouldn't have enough strength to
activate a shield to block attacks.  I was holding onto Tenchi to tight.
"Then he told everyone he loved Ayeka and I got off.  And now look at me!
 I'm pouring my heart out to someone I hardly know!"  The look of disgust
left her face for a look of outrage.  To be tricked into telling Washuu all
that was more then she could bare.  "Ryoko, I could've come out here
sooner
except I knew the only way to comfort you was to get Tenchi's side of
tonight's events."
Ryoko looked at Washuu hardly believing she would go to so much trouble.
"Tenchi said that he only spoke the truth tonight.  And that he could never
have lived your life.  I won't lie because that would hurt more then the
truth."  Washuu said looking at Ryoko as if she were an infant.
"So what?  Am I supposed to be some baby that can't handle anything?"
Ryoko asked looking as if she was in great pain.  "Fine.  You want the
truth?
 Tenchi told me about the first day Ayeka came here and that he was going to

go back to Juri with her.  He also told me what he and Ayeka have been doing

every day after her arrival.  He recalled everything as if it was happening
at that moment!"  Washuu yelled at a shocked Ryoko.
"But, how, why?"  Ryoko searched for lost words.  "Is that what you
wanted to hear?"  Washuu yelled.  Ryoko faded away.

"Tenchi!" Ryoko called flying up the stairs to his room.  She opened his
door to find a most unpleasant site.  Ayeka was asleep in his bed.  "Wake up

bitch!  Where's Tenchi?"  Ryoko screamed holding Ayeka out the window and
planned to make it look like an accident.
"I don't know!"  Ayeka cried trying not to look down.  Ryoko took her
back inside.  "Well I'm going to find him.  And if you're what makes him

happy,"  Ryoko struggled to get the words out.  "Then, I'm happy."  She
finished and faded out of the room.

It was several days before anyone saw Ryoko again.  Mihoshi was the first
one.  Her show was interrupted with a news flash saying they had caught the
space pirate Ryoko and she would be executed in several weeks time.  By this

time everyone was watching the news flash.  The reporter added in a hurried
tone, as though it weren't important that they found Ryoko hold a tear
stained picture and that on the back, it read 'Mom and my family.'
Bringing back his reporter like attitude, he said if anyone knew whom the
people in the picture were, they should have them contact the Galaxy Police.

The screen was filled with a close up of the picture.  They showed the
reporter once more and he said, "Anyone who would like to attend the
execution, should contact the GP HQ exactly one week before the execution
date."
There were several moments of silence, in which Mihoshi burst into loud
tears and Ayeka let silent tears run down her face.  "I'll call the Galaxy

Police.  I need to call anyway to check up on their performance.  Ayeka lied

hurrying to the phone.

"Yes, this is Princess Ayeka."  Ayeka said into the receiver.

"We are pleased to hear from you.  What brings on this call?"  Asked a GP
official.

"Well, I saw the news flash and I know who the people in the picture are."

"Really?  Would you mind telling us?"

"Well, there's Detective Mihoshi, Washuu, Tenchi Masaki, my sister,
Sasami,
and myself."

The official took a while to respond.  "You're sure?"  He finally asked.

"Yes."  Ayeka said sadly.

"Well, the reason we wanted to know is because,"  Ayeka cut him off.

"You wish to know if we will be at the ceremony.  Yes."

"Thank You.  Good-Bye."

The phone returned to the annoying dial tone.  Ayeka entered the living
room where everyone was expecting her.  "The Galaxy Police is expecting us
at
the ceremony."  Ayeka said knowing what Washuu would say.  "What!  They
don't
even give a mother time to say good-bye!"
Mihoshi and Ayeka were about to break into an explanation when the
doorbell rang.  "I'll get it."  Washuu said standing up.  There were
several
seconds of silence before a scream emitted from the entrance hall.  Everyone

ran to see what had happened to Washuu.
They were greeted by a stranger wearing a trench coat, a really weird
hat, and really big sunglasses.  What was even stranger was the person had
Washuu in a tight hug.  "Let me go!  We've never even met!"  Washuu was
screaming at the stranger.
Ayeka tried to pull the person off Washuu, only to receive a blow to the
stomach.  She realized who the person was and quickly devised a plan.  She
went to pull the person off Washuu once more.  The person tried to punch her

again, but knowing what they were going to do Ayeka dodged, and reached out
for their hat.
With success she flipped the hat off their head, causing locks of cyan
hair to fall out of place.  Washuu stopped her struggle to fight off her
daughter.  Everyone was to shocked for words.  "You must only be half of
Ryoko.  There is no way you could escape."  Ayeka concluded.
Ryoko nodded and closed the door before removing the rest of her
disguise.  "Washuu, there are a few things I need to talk to you about."
Ryoko said in a strained tone.  Washuu  nodded and led her daughter to a
private section of the floating onsen.

"I never knew you had a picture like that."  Washuu said trying to find
some good music.

"I try to keep most of my life a secret."  Ryoko said.

"There are some things a daughter should tell her mother."

"I'm not your daughter!"

"Yes, you are."

"NO I'M NOT!  LEAVE ME ALONE MOM!"  Ryoko gasped.

"I knew it!"  Washuu smiled happily.

Ryoko sagged her shoulders in defeat.  The first song on the c.d. started
to play and Washuu told Ryoko to listen.  However, Ryoko denied Washuu's
wish.  "A couple days ago, you told me what Tenchi said.  I was wondering
if,"  Ryoko began.  "No, he didn't mean the stuff you try with him."
 Washuu
read her mind.
"The other day you told me to tell you how I saw things.  Now, it's your
turn."

"Well, I was put into exile after I created you.  They allowed me to find
someone who could take care of you.  I didn't trust anyone.  I left you on

Juri.  I was hoping, someone would raise you better then anyone I knew.  I
even thought maybe, if I left you at the palace, Misaki or Funaho would take

care of you.  I knew that if we ever met again, it would be hard for you to
understand.
"The day before they put me into exile, Kagato came and imprisoned me.  I
was trapped there for what seemed like millions of years.  Later I found out

I was.  I was trapped within my own thoughts.  I realized my mistake of
leaving you on Juri.  There you would learn more about stealing and the
other
federal offenses more then you would anywhere else.
"You began with cheap scams like ripping off your customers at carnival
booths.  When you were a preteen I remember, I first had contact with you.

Even if it was only mentally.  Kagato came across you at a Juri festival.
 It
was Startica.  He promised you he could get you any thing you wanted.  He
said he would show you how to get what you wanted.
"You were young and extremely naive.  You agreed hoping he would show you
a way to get a man to settle down with.  Hoping Kagato would show you other
emotions besides hate and pain.  Whether anyone but myself knew it, I
introduced you to those emotions.  You hated me.  I made you feel pain.  You

didn't even know how letting you go felt.
"When you boarded Kagato's ship I felt your presence nearby.  You were
close enough for contact.  I didn't know what I'd say though.  I thought
of
several greetings.  Each would hurt you more though.  I finally settled on
'Hello.'  After that I could tell we were both slightly happier.
"I brought your astro body to my chamber shortly after Mihoshi freed me.
I explained almost everything to you.  I helped you fight by bringing Ayeka
to the chamber.  I knew you wouldn't have used your full power while Ayeka

was in that part of the ship.  I knew you thought somewhat highly of her."

"What are you talking about?  I hate Ayeka!"  Ryoko objected.  "You
could've used your full power and killed Ayeka.  But, you didn't.  You
knew
it might hurt Tenchi.  You didn't want that.  Even though he later showed
deep affection for you.  You knew he wouldn't hurt anyone by choosing.
"Not until it was necessary anyway.  Now, look where your stubbornness
has gotten you.  About to be executed because you wouldn't listen to your
mother."  "That's it.  I've had enough.  I'm going back to my cell!"
 Ryoko
said putting on her clothes.  She faded from site to join her other half.

Now that Ryoko was alone, she had time to reflect on her life.  "I guess
I never did give Washuu to much credit as my mother.  She was the only
person
I thought would vouch for me.  Now I blew it.  In the little time I was back

at Tenchi's.  Even though, I was being watched carefully by a GP officer,
I
saw Ayeka trying to do more then what I am worth.
"She was always talking to her father, mother, and aunt to release my
charges.  In the rare event she did come out, her face was tear stained.  I
can tell that that was not Tenchi's work.  Everyone abanded their normal
chores to talk to me.  Sasami made all my favorite dishes.  Mihoshi tried
her
best to convince her colleague I was innocent, even though everyone knew she

was wrong.
"Tenchi repeatedly assured me they would find a way to get me off the
hook.  I didn't see Washuu to much.  A little at meals because she was
forced
to.  The day I had to leave Washuu made no effort to say good-bye before
rushing back to her lab.  Now my execution is tomorrow and I'll never see
any
of them again."

The day arrived and everyone went to GP HQ.  Ayeka was dressed in what
Washuu said was appropriate clothing.  Washuu explained that the only person

that the GP officials would listen to was Ayeka.  Mihoshi was dressed in
uniform, Washuu was dressed in her Science Academy uniform, Sasami was
dressed in a traditional Jurian kimono, Tenchi was dressed in a kimono
similar to Sasami's, and Ayeka was dressed as what Washuu said was a
lawyer.

Once in the ceremonial room, a GP official, (They get mentioned a lot in
this story don't they?) went through Ryoko's crime history.  It was a
very
boring process.  Ayeka sat in the back patiently until Washuu told her to do

her part.  Finally, Ayeka got her chance.
After the official asked if anyone objected to the killing of the
'Vicious' Space Pirate Ryoko, Ayeka's hand shot up, "I object sir!"
 The
official closed his eyes as if in prayer that the objection would make no
difference, nodded to Ayeka.  Under normal circumstances he would've
overruled it but it was good for a dramatic effect.
Ayeka walked forward and Ryoko gasped.  Not only was Ayeka, of all people
defending her but also she had undergone a huge change.  Her hair was in
braids and she was wearing a business suit.  She also had a pair of glasses
tucked in her pocket, which she put on once she got up front.  "As Princess
Ayeka, First Princess of Juri, I would like to defend my client, Ryoko
Hakibi."  Ayeka said looking around the room.
"I would like to overrule my daughters objection!" Azusa stood up.
"Daddy, sit down it's my turn!"  Ayeka said.  "Anyway, you skipped a
minor detail in your crime history of Ryoko.  You said, and I quote,
'Ryoko
had preformened all crimes out of her own free will.'  When in truth she
was
under the impression of Kagato.  He was controlling her.  Now, I ask you, if

Ryoko wasn't acting of her own free will, is right to accuse her of these
crimes?"
Silence.  The official sighed, "Alright, after the Princess' statement I
would like a show of hands, who thinks Miss Ryoko has been falsely accused?"

Ayeka once again raised her hand.  Several seconds passed before several
hands in the last row shot up.  Washuu stood up in adult form, "I'll vouch

for my daughters false accusation."  Mihoshi stood up, "I will too!"
Soon almost everyone in the room was standing up and yelling at the
official for putting false information in a crime report.  Azusa was the
only
one still sitting down.  Ayeka walked over to her father and whispered
something in his ear making him stand up.  The official must have felt very
small because he let Ryoko off the hook and everyone cheered.

"So Ayeka, what made you do that?" Ryoko asked on their way back to
Earth.  "Oh, no reason."  Ayeka responded.  Ryoko nodded and went over to
where Washuu was looking out the window.  She was right behind her a went
over to Tenchi.  "Tenchi, why did Ayeka of all people be the first to say I
was innocent?"  Ryoko asked him curiously.  "Like she said, no reason."  He
replied.

"Come on.  I'm not stupid."  Ryoko said and she heard Washuu snort.

"You don't have to know.  All that matters is she vouched for you."
 Tenchi
said to her.

"Then I'll guess."

"Okay."

"It can't just be because she was the only one they would listen to."

"Nope."

"I can tell no one made her."

"Right."

"I know it can't be because you love me.  More than her anyway."

"Uh-huh."

"So it would have to be because she cared about me as a friend.  Right?"

"Yes."  A quiet voice said from behind her.

Ryoko turned to see Ayeka standing there.  "Washuu wants to talk to you."
 Ayeka said making a gesture towards Washuu.

"Ayeka said you wanted to talk to me."

"Yeah.  I was wondering what you were think back there."

"I was thinking, maybeyouwererightaboutyoubeingmymom."

"What?"

"I was thinking about you being my mom!"

"I'm so happy!  I thought about you too."

"You did?"

"Yes.  The whole time I was wondering if Ayeka was going to mess up.  Or,
worse change her mind and not object.  You were all I could think about."

"I guess it takes until you almost lose someone to realize how important he
or she are to you."

Washuu nodded.  They sat for several minutes simply staring at the stars
as they passed by.  "I always thought I would share this experience with
someone I loved."  Ryoko sighed.  "You must be disappointed.  You haven't
got
Tenchi anymore."  Washuu replied.
Ryoko shook her head.  "It took that experience to get my priorities
straight.  I'm happy for him and Ayeka.  And he wasn't the person I
loved
the most all along."  They sat for several minutes staring at the stars once

more.  The whole bridge was quiet.  Ayeka stood in a dark corner.  She
wished
she had that type of love between her father and herself.
"Once upon a time, a self-righteous king had a daughter.  He named her
Ayeka.  He brought her up to feel no real emotions towards other people.
 One
day she ran away with her sister, Sasami.  Sasami had always had the choice
over her emotions and never had to wear a court face.  Sasami knew how to
laugh, Ayeka did not.  Sasami was free,  Ayeka was bound by the chains of
duty.  When they landed on Earth, Ayeka discovered new emotions and hopes
she
never has to forget them."  Ayeka said in a voice that was strained through
tears and was in less then a whisper.
"Do you really mean you care about me more then anyone?"  Washuu asked
her daughter.  "I never had a thought that wasn't almost all out of
selfishness until now."  Ryoko said looking at a dwarf star.  "Ayeka was
brought up to only care about herself."  Ayeka whispered leaving the bridge
to go to her room so she could cry freely.
"I said what I meant and I meant what I said."  Ryoko said.  Washuu
thought her daughter sounded like Horton the Elephant.  "Ryoko, tell me
something.  Why do you,"

"Suddenly care so much?"  Ryoko cut her off.

"No.  Why do you sound like Horton the Elephant?"

"Who's that?"

"Never mind."

Then Ryoko did something Washuu thought she'd never live to see.  Ryoko
pulled her mother into a hug.  "Ryoko, do you really love me as a mother, or

are you trying to get me to leave you alone?"  Washuu asked not fighting the

hug off.
"I love you,"  Ryoko began in a loving tone.  "Mom."

The End

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Thanks for reading

my fic!  I got the idea for the court scene from the movie Legally Blonde.

Here's a preview of my next fic.

We take a voyage into Ayeka's mind to see how she thinks.  We see how
Ayeka's life was on Juri and then when she came to Earth.  We also see why

she left home.  And what I like to call what the creators didn't want you
to
see.   Purple Chipmunk Productions is proud to present- 'Ruby Eyes, Purple

Hair'  Also, a word of warning, my next fan fiction will be placed in the
lemon section.  For some lemon content.
Anyway, enjoy!
