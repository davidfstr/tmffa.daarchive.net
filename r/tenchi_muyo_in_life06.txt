DISCALMER:  I do not own all the characters like Tenchi, Ryoko, Ayeka, 
Mihoshi, and so on in this fanfic, or anything that is own by AIC and 
Pioneer.  Well except for Commander Henrii Lok.  I do not want a lawsuit

Commander Henrii Lok please ask me first.

NO NEED FOR KISSING.
Everybody was in the living room waiting and waiting.  There was total 
silence until a phone call broke the silence.
“I got it,” said Nobyuki.  He reached and grabbed the telephone.
“Hello,” said Nobyuki.
“Yes.”
“Ok.”
“Ok.”
“I got it.”
“I understand.”
“Yes sir I understand.”
“I will be there.”
“Bye.” Said Nobyuki as he hang up the phone.
“Who was it?” said Mihoshi.
“Oh its my boss he wants me to go back to work, so I better be packing up 
and go back to work,” said Nobyuki as he went to his room.  A few minutes 
later Nobyuki came down and said.
“Goodbye everyone,” said Nobyuki holding his suitcase.
“Nice to meet you all.  Please tell me that Ayeka is ok, ok,” said Nobyuki 
putting on his hat.
“Bye Mr. Masaki!” said the girls.
“Bye bye!” said Nobyuki as he went out the door.  Ryoko entered the door.
“Hey everyone!  Is Tenchi’s dad leaving?” said Ryoko.
“Yes,” said Tenchi.
“Why is everybody here not outside,” said Ryoko as she streched and yawn a 
big yawn.
“Ayeka was in the crossfire of the battle that Tenchi and Yukiyou was in,” 
said Sasami.  Sasami was serving lunch to everybody.  The lab door opened.  
Everybody quickly turned their heads to see if it was Ayeka.  Henrii exited 
out of the door.
He gave a sigh and said.
“Tenchi, King Azusa, Queen Funaho, and Queen Miaski you might want to sit 
down,” said Henrii.
“Ok,” said King Azusa as he sat down.
“Ayeka is….. is,” said Henrii.
“Well spill it I don’t have anymore time to waste,” said King Azusa getting 
impatient.
“Ayeka is doing fine and here she is right here!” said Henrii.  Ayeka exited 
the lab and started to dance around.  Tenchi stood up and said.
“Oh god Ayeka you look like a new person,” said Tenchi.  Ayeka danced around 
Tenchi and blew a kiss at him.
“Right now Ayeka is not her normal self.  I had to use a special gas to fix 
her with a side effects of showing deep hidden emotions,” said Henrii.  
Ayeka jumped onto Tenchi’s arms and said to him.
“Would you make hard beautiful love to me? My prince,” said Ayeka.
“Umm err hmm,” said Tenchi turning all red.
“Hey Ayeka get off from my Tenchi!” said Ryoko in a jealous rage.
“Oh yeah you !@!@#$!@#$#!*%&^)(#!@&%*@(#&(^*@&#%(!#())(!#%^*!)#(&$*(!#&%(*! 
&@#)%(*!@$(*!@%&*(!#&%(*&!#%^*(@#&%^(@#*&%&)!(#()*$()*#^@#()*%@(#)&%@#&%*@(#%&*(@#&%)(@#*%)(@*#)(%*@#)%*()@#*%()@#*%)(@*#)%(*@()#%*)@#)#$&!” 
said Ayeka.  Everybody was shock to hear cuss words used in one sentece.  
Mihoshi covered Sasami’s ear and Ryo-Ohki just in case she starts saying it 
again.  Ayeka grabbed Tenchi’s head and started to give him a passionate 
kiss on the lips.  Ryoko turned into hot red and scream and tried to pull 
Ayeka away from Tenchi.
“She should be back in normal in 5,4,3,2,1 back to normal,” said Henrii 
looking at his watch.  Ayeka blink and found herself kissing Tenchi.  Ayeka 
let go of Tenchi and was pulled off by Ryoko onto the floor.  Ryoko and 
Ayeka got up and Ayeka blushed from embarrassment.  Azusa, Miaski, and 
Funaho was stunned what they saw and heard.  Tenchi was on the floor with a 
nosebleed with his mouth open.
“Two can play that game!” said Ryoko.  Ryoko jump onto Tenchi and gave him 
another passionate kiss on his lips.  Ayeka got so angry and grabbed Ryoko’s 
hair to pull away Ryoko from Tenchi.  All of a sudden the girl disappear.
“What happen to my baby Ayeka!” said Miaski.  Sasami, Mihoshi, Azusa, 
Funaho, and Miaski turned their heads to see that Henrii’s arm what 
extending out.
“Where did you move them Henrii?” said Sasami.  A huge splash was heard.
“I moved them outside to cool down,” said Henrii.  Henrii walked to where 
Tenchi was and looked at Tenchi staring in the wall with a nosebleed with 
his mouth wide open.  Henrii took one good slap at Tenchi’s face.
“Wake up Tenchi,” said Henrii.   Tenchi got back up and scratched his head.
“I’m up I’m up!” said Tenchi.
“Henrii, oh Henrii are you there!” said Washu in her lab.  Henrii looked in 
the lab and said.
“I will be there hold on Little Washu,” said Henrii.
“Thank you for helping Ayeka with her wounds,” said Miaski giving Henrii a 
huge bear hug.
“Your wel…com..e,” said Henrii running out of air.
“Does Ayeka have a scar on her beautiful body, Henrii?” said Miaski loosing 
her gripe on Henrii.
“Nope I invented something to heal scars in a matter of seconds and it gave 
a baby smooth body,” said Henrii.
“Oh thank you, you are too good to be true!”  said Miaski putting Henrii’s 
head between her breast.
“Is this your way hugging people Miaski, between your breast,” said Washu in 
her adult form.
“Huh?” said Miaski letting go of Henrii and Washu took Henrii and placed his 
face in her breast.
“This is how you did it Miaski,” said Washu jerking Henrii’s head around her 
breast.
“Oh really!” said Miaski as she grabbed Henrii.
“Let go of him Miaski I don’t think he needs this,” said Azusa.  Henrii got 
dizzy from Washu moving his head and collided with Funaho.
“Oh I’m so sorry,” asked Henrii.
“It's ok Henrii,” said Funaho.
“Oh sorry that I bumped into you,” said Henrii.
“That’s ok Henrii,” smiled Funaho.  The door opens and out comes Ryoko and 
Ayeka trenched wet.
“Oh Henrii!  I’m all wet!” said Ayeka.
“Get into drier clothes,” said Henrii.
“Yeah Ayeka,” said Sasami.  Oh I know what I have to do I have to buy some 
bed sheets Tenchi thought.
“Hey girls do you want to go to the mall?” said Tenchi.
“Yes!” said Mihoshi who jumped out of her seat and started to bounce up and 
down.
“Yeah sure Tenchi!” said Sasami.
“Do you want to go to the mall Washu, Ryoko, Ayeka, Lady Miaski, Lady 
Funaho?” said Tenchi.
“Yeah!” said the all of them.
“Let me quickly get into drier clothes Tenchi,” said Ayeka.
“Yeah me too,” said Ryoko as she teleported and came back in a few seconds.
“I’m not going to this mall I have to go back to Juri, Funaho, Miaski you 
can stay here for a while if you want to,” said Azusa.
“We will have a vacation then,” said Funaho.
“We are going to stay here then,” said Miaski.
“Ok I will return in three earth days,” said Azusa as he left the house.
“Do you want to go to the mall Henrii?” said Henrii.
“Yeah join us Henrii,” said Sasami pulling his left arm.
“Miya miya miya,” said Ryo-Ohki pulling his right arm.
“Ok ok I will go with you guys,” said Henrii.
“Yeah!” said Sasami.
“Miya!” said Ryo-Ohki.

NO NEED FOR A MALL
“So how are we going to the mall?” asked Mihoshi.
“That’s a good question,” said Washu.
“I will get the keys to the van,” said Tenchi as he hurry off to Nobyuki’s 
room.
“I haven’t been to a mall on Earth for a long time,” said Funaho.
“I never been to a mall,” said Henrii.
“Oh you would love it so much!” said Mihoshi jumping up and down.
“Oh really?” said Henrii.
“Yeah I’m going to charge and charge and charge on my grandpa’s card,” said 
Mihoshi holding up a golden credit card as it shine in the air.
“Ohhhhhhh!” said everyone.
“Well I have the same kind!” said Ayeka holding up her credit card.
“I have one too,” said Ryoko looking through her pockets and pulling out 
junk out.
“Ah ha ha ha,” laugh Ayeka.
“Ayeka dear don’t laugh at people’s misfourtne,” said Miaski.
“Sorry mommy,” said Ayeka.  Tenchi came back out to the living room where 
everybody was.
“I got the keys so I’m driving,” said Tenchi.
“Lets go!” said Sasami.
“Miya,” said Ryo-Ohki as they pulled Henrii outside.  Tenchi brought out the 
van and pulled it in front of the house where everyone was standing.
“All a board!” said Tenchi.  Everybody got into the van.  In the back row 
Henrii, Washu, Funaho, and Miaski, and Washu was constantly playing around 
with Henrii.  In the middle row Sasami, Ryo-Ohki, Ayeka, and Mihoshi, 
Mihoshi was very excited and Sasami was playing with Ryo-Ohki.  Tenchi was 
in the driver’s side and Ryoko was at the passenger side.
“We are going to the biggest mall in Tokyo!” said Tenchi smiling.
“Oh yeah!” said Sasami.
“Wahoo!” said Mihoshi.  Many hours past, a lot of minutes past, and so many 
seconds had pass.  Tenchi was getting tired and angery.  Everybody was a 
sleep except for Tenchi and Mihoshi who was still in her shopping high.
“Are we there yet Tenchi?” asked Mihoshi.
“No, Mihoshi we are not there! Yet because of this stupid traffic,” said 
Tenchi
“Oh ok,  Umm Tenchi?” said Mihoshi.
“Yes, Mihoshi?” said Tenchi.
“Are we there yet?” said Mihoshi.  At about 12:02am park the van in the 
parking lot.
“We are finally here!” said Tenchi as got out of the door.  Mihoshi quickly 
got out of the van and ran to the enterence of the mall and started to pull 
on the door.
“Its lock!” said Mihoshi as she started to cry.
“Oh man I’m so tired,” yawn Henrii as he moved Washu’s head from his lap.
“Just great the mall is close,” said Tenchi.
“Wahaaaaaaaa!” cried Mihoshi.  Henrii got out of the van and walked up to 
Tenchi and Mihoshi.
“Its lock?” said Henrii.
“Yep,” said Tenchi looking inside.
“Wahaaaaaaa!” cried Mihoshi.
“I think we should get a room and come back tommorrow and we would have a 
lot of energy,” said Henrii
“That’s a great idea, don’t you think so,” said Tenchi.  Mihoshi slowly stop 
crying.
“Wahaa yes it think that great,” said Mihoshi.  Tenchi, Mihoshi, and Henrii 
got back into the van to find a hotel room that would take people at 12:08.  
They arrived at the hotel Nemui and parked at the parking lot. Henri and 
Tenchi went into the hotel to talk to the hotel clerk.
“Welcome to Nemui,” said the hotel clerk.
“Yes, do you have a room at this time?” asked Tenchi.
“Yes I do, I have five double bed, that all” said the hotel clerk.
“Hey Henrii lets get them all,” said Tenchi.
“Why not,” said Henrii.
“We will take them all,” said Tenchi.
“That would be 15,626 yen please,” said the clerk.
“Here you go, sir,” said Tenchi.
“Thank you, would you like two keys for each room,” said the clerk.
“Sure why not,” said Tenchi.  The clerk drop all the keys on the desk and 
open a door and left.
“Wait a second, Sir,” said Tenchi.
“Ring the bell Tenchi,” said Henrii.
“Good idea, Henrii,” said Tenchi as he ring the bell.
“Odd,” said Henrii.
“Yes very odd,” said Tenchi.
“Which is which?” said Henrii
“I don’t know,” said Tenchi.

NO NEED FOR A HOTEL
“Why don’t we pass out the keys to everyone and see if who got the same room 
and would be roommates,” said Henrii.
“No! What if I get Ryoko or Ayeka,” said Tenchi.
“Its two beds, two, not one bed,” said Henrii.
“You are right,” said Tenchi as he took all the keys and brought it to the 
van, Henrii follows Tenchi.
“Hey girls wake up,” said Tenchi.  All the girls woke up and scratched their 
head, rubbed their eyes, and yawned.
“What going on Tenchi,” said Sasami.
“Miya,” said Ryo-Ohki.
“Take one of these keys and find the room you will be sleeping at ok,” said 
Tenchi.  Everybody got one and Tenchi and Henrii got one too.  Ryoko grab a 
key, winked at Tenchi, and teleported out of the van to the hotel.
“I’m so very very tired,” said Mihoshi as she left the van and entered the 
hotel with her key.
“I’m very tired too,” said Ayeka.
“Go to sleep my Ayeka and you too Sasami,” said Miaski.
“Ok mommy,” said both of them and all three entered the hotel with their 
keys.
“Let me help you out of the van Lady Funaho,” said Henrii.
“Thank you Commander,” said Funaho.
“Its my job,” said Henrii with a smile.  Washu was still sleeping in the 
van.
“Wake up Washu!” said Henrii.
“What, what, what’s going on!” said Washu as woke up in a surprise.
“Get up Little Washu we are staying at a hotel,” said Henrii.
“Oh ok,” said Washu exiting the van and closing the door and went into the 
hotel.  Tenchi went to the driver’s door and locked the van.  Henrii and 
Tenchi didn’t see the girls in the lobby so they went to the elevator and 
went to their rooms.  Tenchi opened his door and see Funaho sitting in the 
room watching TV.
“Oh hello Tenchi,” said Funaho.
“Hello great grandma,” said Tenchi.
“Looks like we are roommates,” said Funaho.
“Where is Miaski?” asked Tenchi
“She is in the room across from us,” said Funaho
“Looks like,” said Tenchi as he jumped onto the bed and started to sleep.
“Good night,” said Tenchi
“Good night Tenchi,” said Funaho
Miaski was in the same room with Mihoshi.
“Go to sleep Mihoshi,” said Miaski.
“I will do that later, but first I need to make a list for things to buy,” 
said Mihoshi.
“Ok, whatever you want,” said Miaski as she covered herself with a blanket 
and started to sleep.  Mihoshi was writing all kinds of things to buy for 
everyone.  All of a sudden she heard a loud yelling from the room next to 
her.
“How in the world I have to be a roommate with you!” said Ayeka.
“Just shut up!” said Ryoko.
“Oh yeah, I rather stick my head in the dirt than be in the same place where 
you sleep,” said Ayeka.
“Oh just shut those holes of yours!” said Ryoko.
“How dare you talk like that to the next Queen of Juri who would be married 
to Lord Tenchi!” said Ayeka.
“He would never marry a girl that gets tired making love that lonely last 2 
minutes,” said Ryoko.
“Why you grrrr!” cried out Ayeka.
“You can’t even pleasure him, I would make him feel like a real man!” said 
Ryoko.  All of a sudden little wooden blocks surrounded Ryoko.
“Why you you bitc… I will kill you!” screamed Ayeka.
“Oh I’m so scared, please don’t send those toothpicks at me again,” said 
Ryoko.  A loud boom was heard thought out the city.  Henrii heard the loud 
boom and wonder what happened.  He found his room and place the key into it 
and opened it.  He looked around and saw two nice bed and heard water 
running in the bathroom.
“Hello anyone there?” said Henrii.
“Hi Henrii, looks like we are roomies,” said Washu holding a towel around 
her chest.
“Yeah yeah, I’m going to sleep,” said Henrii as he press some buttons to 
change into some sleeping clothes.
“Want to take a bath with me?” said Washu.
“Umm let me think, no,” said Henrii as he jumped onto one of the bed.
“Alright,” said Washu as she dropped her hair pin on the floor.
“Hey Washu you dropped your hair pin,” said Henrii as he turned on the TV 
with the remote control.
“Thank Henrii,” said Washu letting go the hand holding the towel and picked 
up the hairpin.  Her towel fell onto the floor.  Henrii’s eyes widen.
“Err Washu,” said Henrii.
“Yes, oh silly me my towel fell of my sexy body, are you sure that you want 
to take a bath with me?” said Washu.  Henrii quickly jumped up out of the 
bed came up to Washu.
“Nay, no thanks I will take a bath in the morning,” said Henrii as jump back 
to his bed.  Washu got her towel and went back to her bath and closed the 
door. Odd he not like most humans on this planet, most of them would take a 
bath with me in no time.  Henrii is just like Tenchi they have so many 
chances and they won’t take it.  Hmm is Henrii and Tenchi gay? thought 
Washu.
