"Star of Jurai", a TENCHI MUYO! fanfic delivered only a few weeks late,
which for me is practically on time, is a little different from most
fanfics you may have read.

SoJ is an "audio drama", inspired by the CD drama tracks so common on
anime CDs these days, as well as my love of old radio shows.  Please
let me know what you think.  It wasn't easy writing a story using only
dialogue and sound effects, but it was fun.

Of course, what I'd like more than anything else is for some
enterprising group of amateur voice actors to actually perform it!  It
could be done, and it would be a great way to prove you could do a
better dubbing job than Pioneer!  :-)

NOTE: One thing missing from the scripts is music.  I've decided to
leave that up to any would-be producer, since I don't have all the
Tenchi CDs...

				PART 1 of 2

*****************************************************************************
					  
			SASAMI (narrating)
Hello, everyone!  Welcome to "Star of Jurai"!  I'm Sasami, and I'll be the
one telling the story!  Let's see, how should I start?  I know!  First, I'll
tell you something about myself!

I'm a princess from the planet Jurai, but I live with my big sister Aeka and
lots of friends at the home of Tenchi Masaki, a boy from a place called Japan.
How we all got together is a really neat story, but it's not the one I'm
supposed to tell you, so I'll tell it real quick.

See, Tenchi let this demon out of its cage by accident, only the demon turned
out to be a girl named Ryoko, and she wasn't a really a demon, she was a space
pirate!  Aeka and I were looking for our big brother Youshou, who was supposed
to have married Aeka but disappeared seven hundred years ago while fighting
Ryoko.  So when we found Ryoko we tried to capture her, so she'd tell us where
Youshou was.

Well, Ryoko didn't know anything!  And then we had this big space fight, and
both our ships crashed.  Tenchi was really nice and let us live with him.

Then a police officer named Mihoshi showed up, looking for a criminal named
Kagato, and she crashed too!

Finally Kagato came.  He said Ryoko belonged to him and kidnapped her!  He
wanted the secret of Tsunami, Jurai's most powerful ship, but we all fought
him together and destroyed him!  That was when we met Washu, a genius
scientist Kagato had captured two thousand years ago!

We found out that Youshou was Tenchi's grandfather.  He'd gotten old because
he wasn't living on Jurai anymore, so he couldn't marry Aeka.  That means
Tenchi will be the next emperor of Jurai someday!

Things are pretty quiet now.  We're all happy living together with Tenchi.
Well, most of the time.  See, Ryoko and Aeka both want to be Tenchi's
girlfriend, and they fight a lot.  Sometimes it causes big problems.  For
example, one time we all went to the beach...

[SouND: Waves, seagulls, people.]

			SASAMI
Aeka?  You don't look like you're having fun.

			AEKA
I'm fine, Sasami.
			
			SASAMI
But you're wrapped from head to toe!  Don't you want to play in the sun?

			AEKA
And expose my beautiful skin to all that radiation?  No, thank you.

			SASAMI
But...
			
			AEKA
When you get to be my age, you have to take good care of your looks!  You'll
understand someday.

			SASAMI
But all you have to do is put some suntan oil on your skin.

			AEKA
Suntan oil?  Let me see that...
	[Pause.]
Is that what that couple over there is doing?

			SASAMI
Huh?  Oh, yeah!   She can't reach her back, so he's putting some on for her.

			AEKA
It looks so... romantic.

			SASAMI
You want me to put some on for you?

			AEKA
[giggles] No.  I have a *much* better idea.

[SND: Electronic beeps on top of the beach noises.]

			WASHU
Fascinating!  Do you that this sand is almost all silicates?  Seems a shame
to waste it by lying around on top of it.

			TENCHI
I, uh, really hadn't given it much thought.

			WASHU
Still, I gotta admit, it sure feels good squishing it between your toes!  Say,
Tenchi!  You haven't said how you like my bikini!

			TENCHI (nervous)
Uh, it's really nice, Washu.

			WASHU
You think so?!  It's actually painted on!  It's this new molecule-thin fabric
I've been working on.  Here, feel it!

			TENCHI
Heh, heh.  That's okay!
			
			WASHU
Oh, don't be shy!  It's just scientific curiosity!  It's healthy!

			MIHOSHI
Hi, Tenchi!
			
			TENCHI (relieved)
Oh, hi, Mihoshi!  How's the water?

			MIHOSHI
It's great!  I especially liked talking to the fish!

			TENCHI
Talking... to the fish?

			WASHU (skeptical)
What did they say?

			MIHOSHI
Well, I don't know really, but they were opening and closing their mouths a
lot, so I figured they were talking to me.  I just have to learn the language!

			WASHU (sarcastic)
Well, good luck.

			AEKA
Tenchi!

			TENCHI
What's up, Aeka?
			
			AEKA
Mihoshi, I couldn't help but overhear how you were talking to the fish.  Why
don't you show Washu!  I'm sure her scientific mind could figure out their
language in no time!

			MIHOSHI
Why, that's a GREAT idea!  C'mon, Washu!

			WASHU
Uh, gee, I really don't know, I mean I'm still analyzing the sand--

			MIHOSHI
Oh, this is much more exciting!  C'mon!

			WASHU (fading into the distance)
No, wait!  This is sensitive scientific equipment!

			MIHOSHI (fading)
Leave it behind!  C'mon, into the water!

			WASHU (fading)
I can't swim!!

[SND: Splash in the distance.]

			AEKA
Tenchi, could you help me?

			TENCHI
Sure, what you need?
			AEKA
I need to put this suntan oil on, but I can't reach my back.  Could you help
me?
			TENCHI
Oh, sure.

[SND: Rustle as Aeka lies down.]

			AEKA
Thanks, Tenchi.

			TENCHI
Like this?

			AEKA
Mmm, yes, thank you.
	[pause]
If the strap's in the way, you can undo it.

			TENCHI
(gulp)

[SND: Ryoko teleports.  Tenchi and Aeka yelp in surprise.]

			RYOKO
Hiya, Tenchi!  Whatcha doin'!

			TENCHI
Ryoko!  I told you not to teleport in public!

			RYOKO
Oh, relax!  Nobody saw.  Well, well!  What *are* we up to?

			AEKA
None of your business!

			RYOKO
Giving the princess a little backrub are we?  Me next!

			AEKA
You don't need suntan oil!  You can fly through a star!

			RYOKO
Who said anything about oil?

			AEKA (feigning interest)
Is that a surfboard you're carrying, Ryoko?

			RYOKO
Sure is.

			AEKA
Then why don't you go surf!

			RYOKO (annoyed)
I'm planning to!
	(brightly)
Say, Tenchi, wanna hang a little ten with me?

			AEKA
Tenchi is *busy*!

			RYOKO
FINE!!

[SND: Ryoko teleports.]

			TENCHI
Wait!  Ryoko!!

			AEKA
Um... Ouch!  Ouch!  My back's getting sunburned!  Please hurry, Tenchi!

			TENCHI
Oh!  Sorry, Aeka.

			AEKA
Ahh...  Thank you, Tenchi.  That's much better.  It's so kind of you to do
this for me...

[SND: A roar that slowly grows louder, followed by distant sounds of panic.]

			VOICE
Tsunami!

			TENCHI
Tsunami?  Where?

			AEKA
I don't see her anywhere...

[SND: The roar continues to grow.]

			TENCHI
Wait a minute.  How do they know about Tsunam--  whuh whuh WAAAAAAAHHHHH!!
TSUNAMIIIIII!!!

			AEKA
Where?  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!

[SND: The roar is near-deafening.]

			RYOKO
HAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA!   SURF'S UP!!!

[SND: Screaming, the crash of an enormous wave.  The noise fades.]

			AEKA
(cough cough)  I've never been so soaked in all my life.
			
			RYOKO
Serves you right for being so stubborn.

			TENCHI (annoyed)
What about the other people, Ryoko?  Someone could've gotten hurt!

			RYOKO
Give me some credit.  I used my power to weaken the wave.  They just got a
little wet, that's all!

			SASAMI
All our stuff was washed away!

			WASHU
Mihoshi and I were in the water!  You nearly hurled us into the parking lot!

			RYOKO
With your power?  Get real!  Besides, Mihoshi's too stupid to get hurt.

			MIHOSHI (near tears)
How... How could you say something like that?!

			TENCHI (angry)
eeerrrrrgg--That's IT!!  Ryoko, I have HAD IT with your selfishness!  You
apologize to Mihoshi right now!  And to the rest of us, too, while you're at
it!

			RYOKO
Tenchi?

			TENCHI
I mean it!!

[pause]
			RYOKO
I... I don't have to take this.
	[SND: Ryoko teleports.]

			TENCHI
(sigh) I didn't think she would.

			AEKA
That was wonderful, Tenchi!  It's about time you told off that monster-woman!

			TENCHI (snapping)
You're just as bad!!

			AEKA
W-what?

			TENCHI
If you hadn't been so rude to her today, she might not have done anything!
You're always provoking her!!

			AEKA
Tenchi...

			TENCHI
Here comes the bus.  Let's go home.

[SND: Inside the bus as it leaves.]

			SASAMI
Um, Tenchi?

			TENCHI (annoyed)
What is it?!

			SASAMI
Um...

			TENCHI
Oh, I'm sorry Sasami, I didn't mean to snap at you.

			SASAMI
That's okay--

			TENCHI
This has just been another tough day.

			SASAMI
I understand, I--

			TENCHI
This happens every time we go somewhere together.

			SASAMI
But--
			
			TENCHI
Can't they get along for just one afternoon?

			SASAMI
I just--

			TENCHI
I guess it's my fault.

			SASAMI
Tenchi?

			TENCHI
I should tell them that they're both important, that they don't need to
compete.

			SASAMI
Tenchi!

			TENCHI
I'm sorry, Sasami, what were you saying?

			SASAMI
Aeka didn't get on the bus with us!

			TENCHI
WHAT?!  Oh, no!  Driver!  DRIVER!

			DRIVER
Yeah?

			TENCHI
You've gotta turn this bus around!

			DRIVER
Sorry, no can do.

			TENCHI
Then let us off!  We'll walk back and catch the next one.

			DRIVER
Ain't no next one.

			TENCHI
AUUUGGH!  (sigh)

			SASAMI
What are we gonna do, Tenchi?

			TENCHI
I guess we'll just have to ask my dad to drive us back and pick her up.

[SND: Bus sounds fade.]

			TENCHI
What do you mean, "The car's not working"?!!!

			FATHER
Now, now, Tenchi, it's a just a small problem.  I'll have it fixed in no
time!
			GRANDFATHER
What your father means by that is that the engine has been taken apart and is
currently strewn all over the garage.

			FATHER
Uh, heh-heh.  Well, after my last tune-up, I had a part left over.  Just
trying to figure out where it went!

			GRANDFATHER
That part was from the lawnmower.

			FATHER
I know that now...

			TENCHI
C'mon, I'll help you put it back together.  Poor Aeka.  It's starting to get
dark.

[SND: Night sounds: crickets, frogs, or whatever equivalent they have in
Japan. :-)]
			AEKA
Tenchi...
	[pause]
Tenchi's right.  I do provoke Ryoko too much.
	[pause]
OOOOOH, but I can't help it!  That nasty monster-woman!  Always trying to get
her paws on Tenchi, to have SEX with him!  Ughk!  The very thought revolts me!
Well, I'm not going to let it happen, do you understand!  If Tenchi's going
to lose his virginity, he's going to lose it to ME!
	[pause]
Um, that's not what I meant.  I mean that, that...  OH!  Listen to me, talking
to myself like a crazy woman!
	[pause]
Oh, why didn't I get on that bus?  It's dark, it's getting cold, and it's
scary out here.
	[pause]
I'm being silly.  What is there to be scared of?

[SND: Hummmmmm-buzz-WHOOSH!]

			AEKA
AAAH!
	[pause]
Ha.. Ha...  Who's there?!
	[pause]
It came from somewhere in those trees...

[SND: Rustle of leaves and branches.]

			AEKA
Excuse me, is someone there?
	[pause]
I, uh, need transportation.  I can pay you.

			VOICE
You don't need to pay!

			AEKA
AAAAAAAAHHH!!
	[SND: Running through the woods.]
AAH!  AAH!!  AAH!  Whoa!  Oof!
	[SND: Aeka falls, crunch of leaves and sticks.]
Ouch!  W-whatever you're thinking of don't do it!  I may look like a
defenseless young woman, but I'm a royal princess of Jurai, and I've been
trained--

			VOICE
Why would I want to hurt you, Aeka?

			AEKA
You... know who I am?

			VOICE
Don't you recognize me?

[pause]                        
			AEKA
Joran?

			VOICE
That's me!

			AEKA (overjoyed)
JORAN!!

[Joyful laughter.]

[SND:  Clinks of metal.]

			TENCHI
This is hopeless!  We'll never get this back together.

			FATHER
Sure we will!  Now, this doohickey goes on this thingamabob.  No it doesn't.
Maybe on this watchamacallit?  Nope, not there either.  Hmm...

			TENCHI
Ohhhhhh...

			WASHU
Ahem!  Mind if I help?

			TENCHI
Washu?

			FATHER
What would a little girl like you know about automobile engines?

			WASHU
Are you kidding?  Primitive engines have always fascinated me!  I'd love to
have a go at one!

			TENCHI
Uh, I don't know, Dad...

			FATHER
What have we got to lose?  Sure, you can help!

			WASHU
(giggles)

[SND: Night sounds.]

			AEKA
Joran, what's happened to you?  You've gotten so... tall!

			JORAN
You were in stasis for seven hundred years, Aeka.  I wasn't.  I grew up.

			AEKA
Oh.  That's right.  How silly of me.  I suppose a lot of things have changed
since I left.

			JORAN
Many things have.  That's one of the reasons Father and I came out to see you.

			AEKA
Uncle Anshou?  He's here too?

			JORAN
Mm-hmm.
			AEKA
All of a sudden, I feel so homesick.  Look at you!  You always were a handsome
boy, but I had no idea you'd grow up to be such...

			JORAN
A hunk?
	[Both laugh.]
It came as a surprise to me, too.  It seemed to happen overnight.  All of
sudden, I was getting attention from all the girls in school, including
those who wouldn't have given me the time of day the year before.  I didn't
quite know how to take it.

			AEKA (teasing)
Oh, it must have been so hard on you.

			JORAN
(laughs) I got used to it.  So how about you?  What's it like, living on
Earth?
			AEKA
I love it here.  I know you think it's a primitive planet, but it's beautiful,
almost like Jurai.  The natives are friendly, most of the time, anyway, and I
live together with a lot of good friends.  It's like having another family.

			JORAN
Then why were you standing out here in the dark, all by yourself?

			AEKA
Um... uh...
	[pause]
It's... a long story.

			JORAN
Okay.  Why don't we go back to Sujahoh and talk about it?

			AEKA
Is that your ship?  It's nearby?

			JORAN
It's in orbit.

			AEKA
Then how did you get down here?

			JORAN
I told you, a lot of things have changed.  Take my hand.

[SND: Hummmmmm-buzz-WHOOSH!]

			FATHER
Thanks for all your help, little Washu!  You certainly are good with tools!

			WASHU
Why, it was nothing!

			TENCHI
Dad and I are going to pick up Aeka.  We'll back in no time.

			WASHU (under her breath)
Heh.  You can say that again.

			TENCHI
What did you say?

			WASHU
Oh, nothing!  Have fun, you two!

[SND: Engine starts.  It sounds... weird.]

			FATHER
Hmm.  Engine sounds a little rough.  I'd better take it easy when I step on
the--

[SND:  SHHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMM!]

			TENCHI & FATHER (fading)
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!

			WASHU
Yahoo!  Am I the Hot Rod Queen, or what?

			MIHOSHI
Um, you know, the speed limit here is only 80 kilometers per hour...

			WASHU
Hey, no prob!  Cops gotta catch 'em first, right?

[SND: Background - low, pleasant thrum.]

			AEKA
Is this... the ship?

			JORAN
Welcome aboard!

			AEKA
But how did we get here?

			JORAN
An interdimensional transporter.  We've only had it for ten years.

			AEKA
The ship...  it's beautiful.

			JORAN
Think so?  She's a little young, only five years out of the nursery, but she's
a fast learner.  C'mon, I'll show you around.

[SND:  Door opens and closes.  Footsteps.]

			AEKA
So, did you receive my report?

			JORAN
Oh, yes!  It's the talk of Jurai!  Especially this "Lord Tenchi" you
mentioned.  Everyone wants to meet him.

			AEKA
Well, perhaps I could introduce you.

			JORAN
That would be wonderful.  Oh, and I wanted to express my sincere condolences
about Youshou.  It must have been so hard to have searched for so long, only
to find he'd passed away centuries ago.

			AEKA
Thank you, Joran.  But it's alright.  He died content, surrounded by his
family.  In the end, that's all you can ask for, I suppose.
	[Pause.]
Sujahoh's lovely, Joran.  Her foilage reminds me of my Ryuuoh.

			JORAN
Ryuuoh?  Was she destroyed?

			AEKA
Yes.  But a seed survived.  I'm regrowing her.

			JORAN
Wonderful!  Then you'll be returning home?

			AEKA
Well, I... I don't know, really.  I like it on Earth.

			JORAN
Not even to visit?

			AEKA
Well, of course I could visit.  I think.  Maybe...  Oh, dear!  My family
doesn't think I'm avoiding them, do they?

			JORAN
Well, quite frankly, we don't know really know what to think.

			AEKA
Oh...

[Pause.]                
	
			JORAN
Aeka, don't be upset, but I have to say this.  You had us worried sick.  I
mean, you were in stasis for seven hundred years.  That may not be as long
to us as it is to your human friends, but it's not exactly a tick of the
clock, either.  If you'd have let us known how you were every century or so--

			AEKA
Oh, Joran, I'm so sorry!  You must understand, Youshou's disappearance had me
so upset.  I didn't know what else to do!

			JORAN
I know, Aeka.  And I'm not angry or anything.  I'm just trying to explain how
it's complicating matters.

			AEKA
What do you mean, "complicating"?

			JORAN
A lot of things are changing back home.  Your father has decided to stop
taking the Water of Life.

			AEKA
Oh...
	[Pause.]
Well, every ruler has to make that decision someday.  I wish I'd been there.

			JORAN
He's strong and healthy.  He should live another five hundred years at least.
But it brings into question the line of succession.  There are still those
who aren't wild about bringing Earth blood into the royal family.  They're
using your long isolation as an excuse to question your fitness to ascend the
throne.
			AEKA
Racists.
			JORAN
Your taking Sasami along messed things up even worse.  As a last resort, she
could have been named successor.  That would at least keep the throne within
the family.  But since she was in stasis as well, she's still a small child.
As it stands now, there is great pressure on the Emperor to name a successor
from another house.

			AEKA
Meddlesome aristocrats.  It makes me wonder if I want to be empress.  What
does Father wish me to do?

			JORAN
He'd like you to come back with us and marry Lord Tenchi, with full
ceremony, in the Imperial Palace.  It would be a sign to all of them that he
has no intention of naming another successor.

			AEKA (embarassed)
Ummm....

			JORAN
You'd live at home, in the palace.  It would give you the opportunity to
demonstrate to the Noble Court that you're not a child, that you're fit to be
empress.  And it would give everyone a chance to meet Tenchi.  It's the
mystery surrounding him that's the biggest problem.  I'm sure once we knew
him, all the objections would disappear.

			AEKA
There... might be a problem.

			JORAN
What kind of problem?

			AEKA
Well, you see, Tenchi and I... we're not officially engaged.

[Stunned silence.]
			JORAN
You mean, he hasn't proposed?!

			AEKA
Well, um, it's, um, rather complicated...

			JORAN
What's complicated about it?  You're Crown Princess!  He's Crown Prince!  You
have to marry!

			AEKA
B-but I don't want to force anything on him!

			ANSHOU
What's going on here?

			JORAN
Father.

			AEKA
Uncle Anshou!

			ANSHOU
You've been talking business, haven't you?  Before I even had a chance to say
hello!
			JORAN
Sorry, Father.

			ANSHOU
Little Aeka!  How lovely you look!  Do you have a hug for your old Uncle?

[Aeka laughs.]

			ANSHOU
Now, let's go sit down.  We'll have some tea, we'll talk about old times,
*then* we'll discuss business.

			AEKA
That sounds lovely.  Oh!  I nearly forgot.  My friends!  They'll be worried!

			ANSHOU
Don't worry.  I left them a message.

[SND: Night sounds.]
[SND: An engine fades in.]

			TENCHI & FATHER (fading in)
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH-OOF!

			FATHER
Well, we're here.

			TENCHI
Thank god.  I thought I was gonna die!

			FATHER
So I overshot the mark a little.  It wasn't all bad.  We got to see the Tokyo
Tower!
			TENCHI
I think that was the Eiffel Tower, dad.

			FATHER
Whatever.  Where's Aeka?

			TENCHI
I don't see her.  Oh, I hope nothing happened to her!

			FATHER
Hmm.  Looks like someone ran into the woods here.

			TENCHI
Why would she go in there?

			FATHER
I dunno.  Let's go see.

[SND: Rustle of leaves and branches.]

			TENCHI
AEKA!!!

			FATHER
AEKA!!!

			TENCHI
Wait, what's this?  Let me have the flashlight.

			FATHER
Looks like a piece of clothing.

			TENCHI
It's a piece of Aeka's dress!  She would have to have been running for it to
tear off like that.

			FATHER
I found something else.

			TENCHI
Aeka wasn't wearing anything like that.  It looks like a military emblem.

[SND: Night sounds fade.]

			GRANDFATHER
Hmmmm...

			TENCHI
Do you recognize it?

			GRANDFATHER
I'm not sure.  It's badly torn.  Let me check the book.

			MIHOSHI
Is Aeka in trouble?

[SND: Ryoko teleports.]

			RYOKO
TENCHI!!!

			TENCHI
Get off me, Ryoko.

			RYOKO
But I just wanted to say how sorry I was about everything!  I'm apologizing!

			TENCHI (annoyed)
It's alright.

			RYOKO
REALLY?!  Oh, Tenchi, that's WONDERFUL!  Let's kiss and make up!

			TENCHI
Not now!

			RYOKO
But a reconciliation isn't official without a kiss!  C'mon, just one little
one!
			TENCHI
Ryoko, Aeka's gone!

			RYOKO
I know that!  Why do you think I'm getting so aggressive?!

			TENCHI
I mean she's missing!

			RYOKO
Oh.  That's different.

			SASAMI (worried)
What did you say?

			TENCHI
N-nothing, Sasami.  Go back to bed.

			SASAMI
Has something happened to Aeka?

			TENCHI
We don't know anything.  She might have just gotten lost in the woods.

			GRANDFATHER
I'm afraid that symbol belongs to a lifelong enemy of Jurai.

			SASAMI
Oh, no!

			MIHOSHI
That's horrible!

			WASHUU
You ain't kidding!  Holding a party without me?

			TENCHI
(sigh) Sit down, everybody.  Grandpa, what do you mean, "lifelong enemy"?

			GRANDFATHER
This is the symbol of the Kizakans.  Throughout the centuries, Jurai and
Kizaka have fought one bloody border war after another.  I'd hoped we'd
heard the last of them just before I left Jurai, but it appears I was wrong.

			MIHOSHI
Um...

			TENCHI
What do these Kizakans look like?

			GRANDFATHER
No one knows for sure.  All the battles were fought ship-to-ship.  No one has
ever managed to catch more than a fleeting glance.

			SASAMI
I heard they have dark skin, long ears, and sharp pointy fangs!

			MIHOSHI
Um, excuse me...

			TENCHI
Brrr!  Sounds scary!

			MIHOSHI
Uh, guys?

			TENCHI
What is it, Mihoshi?

			MIHOSHI
I'm a Kizakan.

[SND: Boing!]
			GRANDFATHER
Ahem.  It appears I have been away from Jurai for longer than I thought.

			MIHOSHI
Oh, yeah!  All that "lifelong enemies" stuff was *ages* ago!  We've been
friends with Jurai for at least three hundred years!

			TENCHI
That's good to know, but then, how do we explain this?

			MIHOSHI
Well.  Hmm.  Let me think.  If I know my history, and I'm not sure that I do,
that's the symbol of the Kizakan Empire, which was overthrown and replaced
with a republic.  Jurai helped, that's why we're friends now.

			GRANDFATHER
So perhaps forces loyal to the old empire have kidnapped Aeka, to further
their cause?

			MIHOSHI
Maybe.

			TENCHI
This is all my fault!  If I hadn't snapped at her, none of this would have
happened!
			SASAMI
Tenchi...
			
			WASHU
Lets find out what we're dealing with.  Follow me!

[SND: Jurai ship sound]

			KUNUZAKE 
Your tea, miss.

			AEKA
Thank you, Kunuzake.  Mm.  My, this is delicious.  It's been so long since I
had Juraian tea.  But shouldn't your guardians be on the bridge?

			ANSHOU
Not necessary.  Ashino and Kunuzake can operate the ship from any position,
even several kilometers outside the hull.  I admit having them serve tea is a
bit silly, but I wanted to give them the chance to impress you.

			AEKA
Well, they have indeed.  Thank you very much.

			ASHINO & KUNUZAKE
Ma'am!

			ANSHOU
It is *so* good to see you again, Aeka.  You can't believe how much we've
missed you.  Why just the other day, Joran was reminiscing about your
favorite spot in the royal redfruit grove.

			JORAN
Father!  That's embarrassing.

			AEKA
How many times did we get caught for picking the fruit?

			JORAN
I lost count.

			ANSHOU
It never stopped him, though, no matter what the punishment.  It was only
after he got sick from eating unripe fruit that he finally stopped.

			AEKA
(giggles) You know, I think the only time I ever really got in trouble is 
when I was with you.  It sure was fun, though.

			JORAN (joking)
Well, I'm glad I gave you something to remember.

			ANSHOU
You know, I'd always hoped the two of you would end up together.

			JORAN
Father, please!  I was four years younger than her.

			ANSHOU
One of the benefits of being such a long-lived race is that, eventually, we're
all the same age, more or less.  But you're right, on reflection, it was
silly of me.  I want to show you something, Aeka.  Here.

			AEKA
What is it?

			ANSHOU
Open it.

			AEKA
It's... beautiful.

			ANSHOU
That, Aeka, is the "Star of Jurai".

			AEKA
Really.  My father had told me about it once.  It's even bigger than I'd
imagined...

			JORAN
It's one of the largest gems of its kind in the universe.

			ANSHOU
More importantly, it symbolizes the bond between my house and yours.  I was
wondering if you would do me the great honor of wearing it on your wedding
day.
			AEKA
Of course I will.  How could I refuse my favorite uncle?

			ANSHOU
Thank you, Aeka.  This means a lot to me.

			AEKA
Besides, it goes with my eyes, don't you think?

[All laugh.]
			ANSHOU
Now, if you'll forgive me, I have some things to tend to on the bridge.  I
should be back shortly.  Ashino, Kunuzake, follow me.

[SND: Beeps and buzzes of Washu's lab.]

			WASHU
Right there, see?  There is definitely a ship in orbit matching the
description of a Kizakan imperial vessel.  Problem is, they're under a heavy
cloak, so I can't contact them from here.  Someone will have to go up there
in a ship.  Preferably an armed one, if I'm reading these power levels right.

			TENCHI
Is Aeka on board?

			WASHU
I can't tell.

			TENCHI
Well, even if they don't have her, they probably know something.  We'd better
get up there.

			RYOKO
No prob!  We'll go in Ryo-oh-ki!

			TENCHI
Great!  The sooner the bet--

			RYOKO
On *one* condition!

			TENCHI
Um, what condition?

			RYOKO
After we've safely rescued the princess...

			TENCHI (apprehensive)
Yes?

			RYOKO
You give me a kiss!

			TENCHI
Aw, Ryoko!

			RYOKO
Hey, I'm letting you off easy!  I could ask you to profess your undying love
for me, or better yet, spend a night playing snuggle-bunnies under the sheets!

			MIHOSHI
We could take my ship!  I've got, like, guns and stuff too!

[Pause.]
			TENCHI
Just one kiss?

[SND: Jurai ship, plus extra noises, beeps, chirps, and hums to signify the
bridge.]
			ASHINO
A launch has been detected from the planet's surface.

			ANSHOU
Identification?

			ASHINO
It is the pirate ship Ryo-oh-ki.

			KUNUZAKE
Two life-forms are inside.  They have been identified as the pirate Ryoko and
Prince Tenchi.
			ANSHOU
Yes!  Right into my hands.  Be patient, Joran.  Your father's about to make
a small change in the line of succession.

			JORAN
Aeka... I want to apologize for being so short with you before.

			AEKA
Oh, Joran, you don't have to--

			JORAN
Yes, I do!  I had no business speaking to you like that.  It was just nerves.
I'd been looking forward to meeting you again for so long, but when I did, I
didn't know what to say.  I mean, I wanted to reminisce about old times, but
I...  I was too nervous...

			AEKA
Nervous about what?

			JORAN
You know...

			AEKA
No...

			JORAN
Oh, come on.  You know I had a crush on you.

			AEKA
Oh...

			JORAN
I mean, I was the little boy, and you were the beautiful older girl.  I got
into so much trouble trying to impress you.

			AEKA
(laughs) Well, it worked!

			JORAN
And now, here you are, just as young and beautiful as the last time I saw
you.
	[Pause]
It's funny.  I'm older than you now, but I still feel like the little boy.    


[SND: A low boom, followed by the rumble of the ship shaking.]

			AEKA
AAH!

			JORAN
What was that?!

			ANSHOU (speakers)
Joran, get Aeka to safety!  We're under attack!

			JORAN
Attack?!  By whom?

			ANSHOU
No time to explain!  Just do as I say!

[SND: Ryo-oh-ki]

			TENCHI
Did you have to do that?!

			RYOKO
Aw, that was just a love tap!  My way of saying hello!

			TENCHI
But what if they shoot back?!

			RYOKO
Kizakans?  Those wimps?  Ryo-oh-ki could take out an entire fleet of those
losers!  Isn't that right, Ryo-oh-ki?

			RYO-OH-KI
MIYA!

[SND: Sujahoh bridge]
			ANSHOU
Thank you, miss space pirate.  Now I don't even have to an invent an excuse!
Ashino!  Kunuzake!  FIRE!!

			ASHINO and KUNUZAKE
Yes, sir!

[SND: Loud energy blast, explosion, rumble]

			TENCHI
AAAAAH!

			RYOKO
DAMMIT!  Those are Juraian weapons!  Ryo-oh-ki, evasive manuevers!!

			RYO-OH-KI
MIYAA!!

			ANSHOU
Oh, no you don't!  Pursue and continue firing!

[SND:  Two energy blasts, rumble]

			RYOKO
UNH!  Damn!  How'd they get Juraian weapons?

			TENCHI
Well, Mihoshi did say they were friends!

			RYOKO
Oh, gimme a break!  Jurai never shares anything!  Ryo-oh-ki!!  Turn and
attack!  NOW!!

[SND: Loud rumble as Sujahoh shakes]

			AEKA
AAA-OOF!

			JORAN
Are you alright?

			AEKA
Yes, I'm--  Oh, NO!  That's Ryo-oh-ki out there!

			JORAN
Ree-oh-what?

			AEKA
The ship!  I know it!  Oh, Ryoko, do you hate me that much?!

			JORAN
You know that ship?

			AEKA
It belongs to a... rival of mine.  Well, this time I'm putting a stop to it!
If she wants an apology, she'll get one!  I'll show Tenchi which of us is the
mature one!  Joran, put me in contact with that ship!

			JORAN
I don't know if that's possible.

			TENCHI
You got 'em good that time!

			RYOKO
Yeah, but I took worse than I got!

[SND: Explosion, ship shakes]

			RYOKO
How ya doin', Ryo-oh-ki?

			RYO-OH-KI
Miyeeew...

			RYOKO
That bad, huh?

			TENCHI
Aren't you used to fighting Juraian ships?

			RYOKO
No, I'm used to running from them!  Only an idiot fights one!

[SND: Explosion, ship shakes]

			RYOKO and TENCHI
AAAAHH!

			ANSHOU
HA HA HAAAA!!  Just a few more good shots should do it!  Don't let up!

[SND: Energy blast, explosion, Ryo-oh-ki shakes]

			RYOKO
That's it!  We're done for!  We've gotta get out of here!

			TENCHI
But Aeka--!

			RYOKO
We'll be destroyed if we stick around!

			TENCHI
I'm not leaving without Aeka!!

			RYOKO
Dammit, Tenchi-- Wait!  There's one last chance!  Ryo-oh-ki!  Head for the
Earth's moon!  As fast as you can!!

			RYO-OH-KI
MIYA!!!

			ANSHOU
Well, this is interesting.  Pursue!

			JORAN (speakers)
Father?  This is Joran.

			ANSHOU
What is it, Joran?  I'm rather busy.

			JORAN (speakers)
I understand, Father.  But Aeka believes she can halt the pirate ship's 
attack, if only she can be put in contact with it.

			ANSHOU
Really?  Unfortunately, the communication system was damaged in the attack.

[SND: Sujahoh, no bridge noises]

			JORAN
I see.  Sorry to have bothered you, Father.

			AEKA
There must be some way to contact Ryoko.

			JORAN
Of course!  I've got a portable comm terminal.  Stay here, I'll bring it.

			TENCHI
Wow.  I never thought I'd ever be this close to the Moon.

			RYOKO
We're gonna get a lot closer.

			TENCHI
Uh, w-what are you planning?

			RYOKO
Just hang on to something sturdy.

			TENCHI
(gulp)

			ANSHOU
So, they're going to hide behind the planet's moon.  How pathetic.  Ashino!
Kunuzake!  Take us around the moon, on an opposite vector.  We'll meet them
on the other side.

			TENCHI (nervously)
We're getting awfully close.

			RYOKO
Ryo-oh-ki, are you ready?

			RYO-OH-KI
MIYA!!

			RYOKO
GO!!

[SND: Engines fire full power]

			TENCHI
AAAAAAAAHHHHH!!

			RYOKO
HANG ON!!

			TENCHI
WE'RE GONNA CRASH!!

			RYOKO (straining)
NO... WE'RE NOT!  WE'RE JUST GOING TO...
	[SND: sssssSSSSSSSHHHHHHHOOOOOMMM!]
SLINGSHOT!!

			ANSHOU
I don't get this... Where are they?  Where-- MY GOD!!  EVASIVE MANUEVERS!!
EVASIVE--!!

			RYOKO
FIRE!!!!

[SND: Massive firing, explosions, rumbles.]

			ANSHOU
RETURN FIRE!!

			ASHINO
Weapons offline!

			ANSHOU
No...

			RYOKO
HAHAHAHAAA!!  YES!  YES!!  KICKED IT'S *ASS*!!

			TENCHI
Great!  Let's get Aeka out of there!

			RYOKO
No prob!  Oh, look!  They want to surrender.
	[SND:  Bee-boop!]
This Ryoko, Space Pirate Supreme!  You will hand over the Princess Aeka at
once, or face the conseque-- Huh?  Aeka?

			AEKA (speakers)
Ryoko, please stop this senseless attack!  I'm sorry I was rude to you!

			RYOKO
What the hell are you talking about?

			AEKA (speakers)
I'm sorry that I was rude to you at the beach.  In the future, I'll--
Tenchi?
			TENCHI
Aeka, are you alright?

			AEKA (speakers)
I'm fine.  Why did you let Ryoko attack our ship?  Is Ryoko threatening you?

			TENCHI
We're trying to rescue you!

			ANSHOU
What is going on?  We're helpless as a newborn.  Why don't they finish us
off?  Or at least issue demands.

			KUNUZAKE
Sir, weapons are operational.

[pause]
			ANSHOU
Fire.

			AEKA
Rescue me?  From what?

			TENCHI (speakers)
Weren't you kidnap--ZZZZAAKKKKZZT!
	[SND: Tenchi's voice dissolves into static, followed by silence.]

			AEKA
Tenchi?  Tenchi?

[SND:  Massive explosion]

			ANSHOU
HAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA!  Blown to PIECES!!

			AEKA
Nuh...  Nuh... No.  N-NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!  TENCHI!!
TENCHIIIII!!!!
			SASAMI (narrating)
Oh, dear!  Is this the end of Tenchi?  Has our handsome hero been blown to
ashes in the cold vacuum of space?  (laughs)  Well, of course not, silly!
But if you want to find out how he survived, you'll have to tune in to the
conclusion of "Star of Jurai".  Until then, this is Sasami, signing off!

				PART 2 of 2

*****************************************************************************
					  
			SASAMI (narrating)
Hi!  Welcome to the conclusion of "Star of Jurai"!  I'm your host, Sasami!
Here's what's happened so far:

It all started when Aeka and Ryoko got into another fight, this time during
a trip to the beach.  But this time, Tenchi got really mad at both of them!
Aeka was so upset, she didn't get on the bus to go home!  Tenchi came back
with his father to look for her, but by that time, Aeka had met a childhood
friend named Joran!  He'd come all the way from Jurai to see her, and so he
took her back to his ship, the Sujahoh, up in space!  There they met Anshou,
Joran's father and Aeka's uncle.

Here's the weird part: when Tenchi and his father looked for Aeka, they found
pieces of her clothing, and an emblem from a military uniform.  The emblem
belonged to the Kizakans, an ancient enemy of Jurai!  Then Washuu told us 
that the ship in orbit was Kizakan!  Well, of course, we all thought Aeka had
been kidnapped!  So Tenchi and Ryoko took Ryo-oh-ki to go after her!  Of
course, the Kizakan ship was really Joran and Anshou's ship in disguise!
There was a big space battle, and Ryo-oh-ki was blown to pieces!

How horrible!  Did Tenchi survive?  What about Ryoko and Ryo-oh-ki?  Let's
find out!

[SouND: Bridge of Sujahoh]

			ANSHOU
Status of enemy vessel?

			ASHINO
Completely destroyed.  The ship has been shattered into small fragments.

			ANSHOU
Then that's that.  Keep me apprised of any developments in Sujahoh's healing
process.  Let me know as soon as we can get underway.

			KUNUZAKE
Yes, sir.

			ANSHOU
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a grieving young lady to console.

[SND: Aeka sobbing.]

			JORAN
Aeka...

			AEKA
It's all my fault.  It's all my fault...

			JORAN
No.  No it's not--

			AEKA
Yes it is!  If I hadn't always been picking fights with Ryoko, if I hadn't
been such a, such a bitch!

			ANSHOU
Thank god you two are alright!  The danger's past now.
	[Pause]
Perhaps I spoke too soon.  Has Aeka been injured?

			JORAN
Father...

			ANSHOU
What it is, Joran?

			JORAN
Father, Lord Tenchi was on that ship.

[Pause]
			ANSHOU (incredulous)
You can't be serious.
	[Pause]
My god, you *are* serious...  How...  But...  He, it attacked...  You're 
certain he was on board?

			JORAN
Yes, Father.  We contacted him moments before the ship was destroyed.  I was
about to tell you, but...

			ANSHOU
Oh, dear god...  I...  How...  I have to sit down...

			AEKA
It wasn't your fault, Uncle Anshou.  It was mine.

			ANSHOU (desperate)
But how??  I don't understand!  That... that was a *pirate* ship!!

			JORAN
Father, perhaps now is not a good time for explanations.

			ANSHOU
I understand.  Joran, take Aeka to the guest quarters.  We'll set off for
Jurai as soon as Sujahoh is ready.

			AEKA
No!  I have to go home-- I mean back to Earth!  Sasami--

			ANSHOU
I'll send a message to her.

			AEKA
B-but can't we pick her up?  That transporter thing--

			ANSHOU
Was destroyed in the battle.  And Sujahoh's too damaged to land.

			AEKA
But...

			ANSHOU
Aeka, please.  If what you say is true, we have to return to Jurai
immediately.  And your testimony is the only thing that can prevent my
execution!

			AEKA (weakly)
I understand...

[SND: Low thud, followed by low rumble]

			JORAN
What was that?

			ANSHOU
We must've struck a piece of debris.  Take Aeka to safety.  I'll see about
manuevering us away.

[SND: Voices echo in a small chamber.]

			TENCHI
Are we alive?

			RYOKO
Of course, silly!  You didn't I'd let you get hurt, did you?

			TENCHI
What is this thing?

			RYOKO
I improvised an escape pod from one of Ryo-oh-ki's bigger crystals.

			TENCHI
A little... tight, isn't it?

			RYOKO
Hee hee!  Just the way I like it!

			TENCHI
Wha-?  Hey!  Ryoko, knock it off!
	[Ryoko giggles]
Wait a minute!  What happened to Ryo-oh-ki?!

			RYOKO
The ship was completely destroyed.  But I saved the most important part!

			RYO-OH-KI
Miya!

			TENCHI
Oh!  Ryo-oh-ki!  What a relief!  Are you okay?

			RYO-OH-KI (happily)
Miya!  Miya!

			TENCHI
So, how long before she can turn into a spaceship again?

			RYOKO
Not long.  A few months, maybe?

			TENCHI
(sigh)  So we're stuck here.

			RYOKO
No we're not.  We can go into that ship.  I'll grab you and we'll go through
the wall.

			TENCHI
Out of the frying pan, into the fire, huh?  If we're going to do that, we'll
need help.  Ryo-oh-ki, can you fly back to Earth by yourself?

			RYO-OH-KI
Miya!!

			TENCHI
Good.  I want you to take someone a message...

			JORAN
Here we are.  It's not much, I'm afraid.

			AEKA (miserable)
It's lovely, thank you.

			JORAN
Aeka, please don't blame yourself for this.

			AEKA
Who else can I blame?

			JORAN
No one.  Sometimes things just happen, Aeka.  A chain of events gets set in
motion and there's nothing anyone can do.

			AEKA (angrily)
Is that supposed to make me feel better?!

			JORAN
N-no!  I mean...  I'm sorry.

			AEKA
Oh, Joran, I'm so sorry.  I didn't mean to snap.  I just...
	[She breaks down and starts to cry again.]

			JORAN
Oh, Aeka.  I'm so sorry.  Come here.

[SND: The sound of Aeka's crying changes, so that it's coming from speakers.]

			ANSHOU
That's it, Joran.  Hold her.  Comfort her in her time of need.  Let that
comfort grow into love.  Soon you'll be standing beside her in the Juraian
palace.

			RYOKO
Well, waddya know?  My hunch was right!  This *is* a Juraian ship!

			TENCHI
Juraian?  Not Kizakan?

			RYOKO
Nope!  A Juraian ship in disguise.

			TENCHI
But why would they do a thing like that?

			RYOKO
Hey, you're asking me?  So, Tenchi, you're the boss.  What do we do now?

			TENCHI
Uh, I don't really know.  I don't have much experience in this kinda thing.

			RYOKO
Well, luckily for you, I do!  Here's my suggestion.  I'll look for the
princess while you take control of the ship.

			TENCHI
Take control of the ship?!  How am I supposed to do that?!

			RYOKO
You brought your sword, didn't you?

			TENCHI
Oh, right.  The "master key".

			RYOKO
Correct!  You can control any Juraian ship with that thing.  Now let's get
going before your "help" shows up.

			TENCHI
But--!
	[SND: Ryoko teleports]
But I don't know where the control room is!

[SND: No ship noises of any kind.]

			MIHOSHI (humming)
Hmm-hmm-hmm...  (giggles)  I love this manga!  I wonder if I can talk Tenchi
into buying me the next volume...

			RYO-OH-KI (excitedly)
Miya!!

			MIHOSHI
Oh, hi, Ryo-oh-ki!  You want to read manga with me?


			RYO-OH-KI
Miya!  Miya!

			MIHOSHI
Say, didn't you go with Ryoko and Tenchi?

			RYO-OH-KI
Miya!  Miya!  Miya!

			MIHOSHI
You sure are jumping around a lot... Oh!  I know what the problem is!

			RYO-OH-KI
MIYA!

			MIHOSHI
You're hungry!  I'll get you a carrot!

			RYO-OH-KI
Errgh...

			MIHOSHI
Wh-what are you doing?

[SND: growing noise]

			MIHOSHI
Haha!  That's so cool the way you turn into a little girl like that!

			RYO-OH-KI
Tenchi in trouble!

			MIHOSHI
(claps)  Yay!  You can talk, too!  Say something else!

			RYO-OH-KI
(sigh)

			TENCHI
(sigh) This is hopeless.  I have no idea where I'm going.  Pretty soon, I'm
going to be discovered...

			LITTLE GIRL
Excuse me...

			TENCHI
Yaah!  Oh, uh, h-hi there, little girl.  I suppose you're wondering what I'm
doing on your ship!

			LITTLE GIRL
Is that the master key?

			TENCHI
This?  Uh, yeah...

			LITTLE GIRL
Then I guess I have to obey you.

			TENCHI
Who are you?

			LITTLE GIRL
You mean you don't know?  I'm Sujahoh.  Pleased to meetcha!

			TENCHI
That's a nice name.  Do you live here?

			SUJAHOH
You mean, in space?  I live wherever my master takes me.

			TENCHI
Oh... I think I understand.  You're the ship, aren't you?

			SUJAHOH
Uh-huh.

			TENCHI
Well, I'm glad I met you.  So you obey the master key, right?

			SUJAHOH
Uh-huh.

			TENCHI
Great!  What I'd like you to do is turn yourself around and go back to Earth.
Could you do that?

			SUJAHOH
(giggles)  It doesn't work like that, silly!  You have to put the master key
in the interface!

			TENCHI
Where is this interface?

			SUJAHOH
Come on, I'll show you!

			ANSHOU (speakers)
Joran, please come to the bridge.  I need to speak to you.

			JORAN
Do you think you'll be alright for awhile?

			AEKA
I'll be fine.
	[pause]
Joran... Thank you.  I don't think I could get through this without you.

			JORAN (flustered)
I'll, um.  I'll be right back, okay?

[Pause]
[SND: Ryoko comes through the wall.]

			RYOKO
Oh, this is so touching!  Where's a hanky when I need one?

			AEKA
Ruh-RYOKO??!!

			RYOKO
"Oh, Joran, I'm so sad!  Please hold my beautiful young body while I weep
into your strong, chiseled chest!"  Geez, you've been watching too many
soaps!
			AEKA
Th-then Tenchi... he's alive?

			RYOKO
Well, of course he is!  Don't be ridcul--OOF!!  Hey, get off me!!

			AEKA
OH, THANK YOU, RYOKO!  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!  I should have known
better!  Nothing could hurt him with your powers protecting him!

			RYOKO
You're hugging me!  I don't know whether to be amused or disgusted!

			AEKA
Sorry, I'm just so relieved, so HAPPY!  I... Wait a minute.  Why I am being
so nice to you?!  You attacked our ship!

			RYOKO
We were trying to rescue you!  We thought you'd been kidnapped!

			AEKA
Kidnapped?  By a Juraian ship?!

			RYOKO
It doesn't look Juraian from the outside.

			AEKA
I don't know what you're talking about.  Besides, we sent you a message!

			RYOKO
Only message we got was a scrap of a Kizakan military uniform.

			AEKA
This makes no sense at all.  Why would Uncle Anshou...

			RYOKO
If "Uncle Anshou" is the old guy running the show, then I don't think he's
the guy you think he is.  I caught a glimpse of him while I was searching for
you.  He's grinning like the cat who ate the canary.

			AEKA
I don't understand this...

			RYOKO
But, hey!  It's no matter to you!  You just go home with Joran and make him
a good wife!  I'll take care of Tenchi while you're gone.

			AEKA
W-WHAAAT?!

			RYOKO
Oh, Princess, you are *such* an inspiration to me!  You see, now that I know
you're okay, and my conscience is clear, I'm going to go back and tell
Tenchi that you were killed in the battle!

			AEKA
You WOULDN'T!!

			RYOKO
"Oh, sob, sob.  How can I go on without Aeka?"  "Oh, Tenchi!  Rest your head
between my breasts and I'll make the pain go away!"  "Ryoko... Thank you.  I
don't think I could get through this without you."  Smoochie smoochie!

			AEKA
NO!  I WON'T LET YOU!!

			RYOKO
And what are you going to about it?  I found an escape pod on the way here.
Tenchi and I will rocket back to Earth, leaving you to your wedded bliss!

			AEKA
You just try to keep me away from Tenchi!  You won't succeed!

			RYOKO
You think not?  Trust me, Princess, set one foot on Jurai, and you'll never
see Earth again.  Toodle-loo!

[SND:  Ryoko leaves through the wall.]

			AEKA
DAMN YOU!  COME BACK!

			JORAN
Father, you wished to speak to me?

			ANSHOU
Yes.  It's about Aeka.

			JORAN
I was just with her, she's fine.

			ANSHOU
That's good to hear.  Joran, the immediate future for Aeka is going to be
very difficult.  She's just lost her fiancee, and now the Noble Court will
be making demands of her.  They'll allow her a mourning period, of course,
but it won't be enough.  She's going to need someone to stand by her.  She's
going to need you, Joran.

			JORAN
I have always stood by Aeka, Father.  I always will.

			ANSHOU
I understand.  But the time may come when she requires more than a friend.

			JORAN
What are you saying?

			ANSHOU
There is a very real possibility that the Court will put pressure on her
father to marry her off as soon as possible.  If that happens, I'd rather
not see her forced into an unhappy marriage.

			JORAN
You'd rather see her married to me.

			ANSHOU
I promised you long ago that I'd never arrange a marriage for you.  And yet,
when I saw you and Aeka become friends, I had hoped in my heart...

			JORAN
There is nothing I would like more than to marry Aeka.  But under the
circumstances, I don't think it would be right to ask.

			ANSHOU
Don't ask her.  Just be there for her.  So that if she needs someone to fill
that role in her life, you'll be there.

			JORAN
I understand, Father.

			ANSHOU
Go to her now.  She needs you.

			JORAN 
Yes, Father.

[SND: Deep humming]
			SUJAHOH
Well, here we are!

			TENCHI
Thanks, Sujahoh.  You're a good ship.

			SUJAHOH
Thank you!  Oh!  Someone's coming!

			TENCHI
Where?

			SUJAHOH
Outside.

			ANSHOU
What is it, Kunuzake?

			KUNUZAKE
A Galaxy Police vessel.  We are being hailed.

			ANSHOU
Galaxy Police?  They don't have any jurisdiction here.  Is our disguise
field still up?

			ASHINO
No.  It was deactivated after the battle.

			ANSHOU
Good.  Answer the hail.

			MIHOSHI (speakers)
This is Galactic Police vessel Yukinojou to Juraian vessel, Lieutenant
Mihoshi speaking!

			ANSHOU
This is the Juraian vessel Sujahoh, Lord Anshou commanding.  How may I be
of assistance?

			MIHOSHI
Um, I'm supposed to find this Kizakan ship, but I'm here, and all I see is
you.  Did you maybe see the ship I'm looking for?

			ANSHOU
Ah, sorry, but no.  I wish I could help you.

			ASHINO
We are being scanned.

			ANSHOU
Shield up.  Ahem!  Miss Policewoman, unauthorized scans are not very polite,
especially considering that you have no jurisdiction in this system!

			MIHOSHI
Oopsie!  Must have pushed the wrong button!  I'm such a klutz!
	(whispers:)
Yukinojou?
			YUKINOJOU (whispering)
Five people on board: three Juraian, one Human/Juraian cross, and one energy
lifeform.
			MIHOSHI
Wow.  That's them alright.  Um, Mister Anshou?  I'm gonna have to ask you to
stay here for awhile while I write up a citation.

			ANSHOU
A citation?  For what?

			MIHOSHI
Ummmm...  Tinted windshield.  Too dark.

			ANSHOU
This is ridiculous!  You have no jurisdiction!

			MIHOSHI
Won't take more than a moment!  Bye!

			ANSHOU
DAMMIT!!  She knows!  She *must* know!  We have to get rid of her!  Power up
the weapons!
			ASHINO & KUNUZAKE
YES, SIR!

			MIHOSHI
Okay!  Now, what next?  Let's see, how can I keep them here long enough to
rescue everyone?  Or at least to figure out what's going on?  What would you
recommend, Yukinojou?

			YUKINOJOU
EVASIVE ACTION!

			MIHOSHI
You mean, I should act evasive and stall them?  Sounds good!

			YUKINOJOU
No, EVASIVE ACTION!!

			MIHOSHI
What do you...  AAAAAAHH!!
	[SND:  Explosion, rumble as Yukinojou shakes.]
Aah!  Shoot back!  Shoot back!

[SND:  Explosion, rumble of Sujahoh]

			ANSHOU
What happened?!  We should have been able to avoid that!

			ASHINO
Something's wrong!  Our manueverability is hampered!

			ANSHOU
Here she comes again!  FIRE!!

[SND:  Explosion, rumble]

			AEKA
What NOW?!
	[SND:  Rumble!]
Oh, Joran!  Please hurry back!

[SND:  Explosion, rumble]

			JORAN
Dammit!  Who's shooting at us now?!

			SUJAHOH
Ouch!

			TENCHI
Are you okay, Sujahoh?

			SUJAHOH
Someone's hurting me!

			TENCHI
Just hang on.  I'm going to take control, and then I'll tell the person to
stop hurting you!

[SND:  Explosion, rumble]

			ANSHOU
DAMN!  Don't we have any manuvering capability at all?

			ASHINO
Not enough!

[SND:  Explosion, rumble]

			KUNUZAKE
It is a balance problem!  A large fragment of the pirate vessel is embedded
in our hull!
			ANSHOU
Get rid of it!

			KUNUZAKE
Not possible under these conditions!

			MIHOSHI
HAHA!!  Whee!!  I'm really kicking butt!!

			YUKINOJOU
Um, Mihoshi?

			MIHOSHI
Not now, Yukinojou!  I'm about to win my first space battle in years!

			YUKINOJOU
Have you considered what will happen if you win?

			MIHOSHI
Sure!  I'll just totally smash up their ship, and then... Oh.  Right.  Tenchi
and Ryoko and Aeka.  Hmm.  I guess we've beaten them up enough.  Let's talk
surrender.  Hee hee!  This is great!

			TENCHI
Okay, the master key goes here, right?

			SUJAHOH
Right.

			TENCHI
Now, I concentrate, and...

			ANSHOU
This is an outrage!  I am a Lord of the Noble Court of Jurai!  This is
Juraian territory!  I will not surrender my craft to you!

			MIHOSHI
Well, I suppose I could shoot you some more...

			ANSHOU
Do you know what Jurai could do to the Galaxy Police if we wanted to?  We
could wipe your pathetic security force out of existence!!

			MIHOSHI
If you're going to resist arrest, it'll make it even worse on you.  Of
course, you've already resisted a great deal, so I suppose a little more
won't matter...

			ANSHOU (livid)
"ARREST"?  ME?!!  I won't stand for it!  FIRE!!  Blow her out of the sky!!

[SND: Ship noises slow to a stop.]

			ANSHOU
What?

			MIHOSHI
Oh!  You've decided to cooperate!  Thank you!  I'll be sure to note that in
my report!  I'll just tow you back to Earth and we'll straighten everything
out there.  Okay?  Bye!

			ANSHOU
But I didn't...
	[SND: rumble...]
What happened?

			KUNUZAKE
We are being towed.

			ANSHOU
No.  Before that.  Why did we shut down?

			ASHINO
The command was given.

			ANSHOU
On whose authority?!

			ASHINO
The master key.

			ANSHOU
The master...
	[Angrily:]
A piece of debris stuck in the hull.  I am a FOOL!!  Ashino!  Kunuzake!
Intruder alert!!  Full security!

			TENCHI
Whew.  That takes care of that.

			SUJAHOH
Is everything okay?

			TENCHI
I think so.  Thanks, Sujahoh.

			SUJAHOH
I'm gonna go now.  I have to fix myself, and it's hard to make myself seen
like this.
			TENCHI
Okay.  Bye!  Thanks again!

[SND:  She vanishes with a buzz]

			JORAN (cold)
You seem to have made friends with my ship.
	[pause]
At a loss for words?  Very well, let me introduce myself.  I am Joran,
noble--
			TENCHI
This is your ship?

			JORAN
Yes, I said--

			TENCHI
What have you done with Aeka?

			JORAN
She's in a safe place.

			TENCHI
Take me to her.

			JORAN
Ha.  I don't think so.

			TENCHI
Take me to her NOW!

[SND: Tenchi activates the sword blade]

			JORAN
You do know how to use the master key.  You must truly be the Crown Prince
of Jurai.  Of course...
	[SND:  Joran activates a blade]
I am armed as well.  Shall we go at it?

			TENCHI
If that's what it's going to take to get Aeka back.

			JORAN
DEFEND YOURSELF!
	[SND:  Clash of swords]
What are you planning to do with Aeka once you find her?

			TENCHI
I'm taking her home!

[SND: Clash of swords]

			JORAN
Funny, so am I!  Hyah!
	[SND:  Clash of swords]
So, tell me, "Lord" Tenchi, is it normal behavior for Crown Princes to
consort with pirates and attack Juraian ships?

			TENCHI
We were trying to rescue her!

[SND: Clash of swords]

			JORAN
Rescue her from who?  Her own people?!

			TENCHI
You can't be her own people!  Uhn!

[SND:  Clash of swords]

			JORAN
What makes you say that?!

			TENCHI
Because!
	[SND: Clash of swords]
Her own people wouldn't disguise themselves as an enemy and kidnap her!

			JORAN
Kidnap her?  What are you talking--

			RYOKO
TENCHI!!!
	[SND: Ryoko fires several energy blasts]
You leave Tenchi alone, you jerk!!

			JORAN
Ah!  You must be Tenchi's girlfriend, Ryoko!

			TENCHI
Uh, it's not exactly like that...

			RYOKO
Yeah, I'm his girlfriend!  So lay off unless you want to get cut to pieces!

[SND: Juraian force-field]

			RYOKO
SHIT!  Force field!
	[SND: Ryoko teleports]

			JORAN
Hmm.  She must have experience escaping Juraian force-fields.  Still, she
won't bother us again.
	[pause]
I'm impressed, Tenchi.  There was a brief period while I was generating the
force field when you could have attacked me, yet you chose not to.

			TENCHI
That's not the way I was taught to fight.

			JORAN
I attacked you because you were sabotaging my ship.  It fit my opinion of
you.  In my belief, no Earth-raised Crown Prince could ever be capable of 
ruling Jurai.  Yet, you show considerable skill in handling the master key,
both as a tool and a weapon, and you show that you understand the principles
of honorable combat.  Perhaps I was wrong.

			TENCHI
Then you'll take me to Aeka?

			JORAN
No.  Not until you explain why you attacked my ship.

			TENCHI
I told you!  I thought you'd kidnapped her!

			JORAN
That makes no sense!

			ANSHOU
Then perhaps I should clear it up.

[SND: Ryoko comes through a wall.]

			AEKA
Ryoko?!  What are you doing here?  Come to taunt me some more?

			RYOKO
Change of plans.  Take my hand.

			AEKA
I'm not going *anywhere* with you!

			RYOKO
You wanna save Tenchi's life?

			AEKA
You'll take me to Tenchi?

			RYOKO
Yeah.  I guess I'd rather share him with you than not have him at all.  Come
on!
			JORAN
Father, what is happening?

			ANSHOU
You heard him.  I disguised Sujahoh as a Kizakan warship and tricked Tenchi
into believing I'd kidnapped Aeka, in the hopes he and his pirate friend
would come after her.

			JORAN
But, why?  Why would you do such a thing?

			ANSHOU
Why?  Just look at him!  Oh, he can swing a sword, and he knows about honor.
But Emperor material?  This Earth-raised whelp?  Don't make me vomit.

			JORAN (shocked)
Father...

			ANSHOU
You listen to me, you little piece of half-breed trash.  I have waited for
four thousand years!  I have waited since the time your pathetic race was
living in mud huts and worshipping rocks!  I have waited all this time for a
promise to be fulfilled, and I'm not about to let you snatch it away from me!

			TENCHI
I don't know what you're talking about!

			ANSHOU
Of course you don't, you ignorant alien.

			JORAN
But, Father.  I don't understand, either.

			ANSHOU
The Star of Jurai, Joran.  It's more than a symbol of friendship between two
houses.  It is a promise that someday our houses will be united on the
throne!  I'd waited all my life for that promise to be kept, and when the time
finally came, when I had a son and the emperor a daughter, what did he do?  He
decided she'd marry her own half-brother!  Oh, he apologized.  "Anshou, my
good friend.  The time just isn't right.  We need the fresh blood of
Youshou's human heritage.  Perhaps in the next generation."  Well, damn the
next generation!  I've been promised the throne, and I'm going to take it,
by any means necessary!

			JORAN
Father, I can't believe this.

			ANSHOU
Believe it, Joran.  I didn't want to involve you.  I wanted you kept pure.
But that's no longer possible.  Now, will you do your duty, and kill the
pretender?

			JORAN
I want no part of this.

			ANSHOU
I thought as much.  Oh, well.  What do those Humans say?  "If you want a job
done right, do it yourself."

[SND: Energy blast]
			TENCHI
AAAGGH!
	[SND: THUD!]
OONF!
			JORAN
Father, don't!

			ANSHOU
Don't try to stop me, Joran.  Afterwards, you can do what you like.  Hate me,
even kill me, I don't care.  All I care is that you marry Aeka.  I know you
will.  You love her and she loves you.
	[pause]
Well?  What are you doing, boy?  Defend yourself!

			TENCHI
You... bastard...

			ANSHOU
That's the spirit!

[SND: Energy blast]
			TENCHI
AAAAUUUGGH!

[SND: Ryoko arrives]

			RYOKO & AEKA
TENCHI!!

			RYOKO (attack yell)
AaaaaaaAAAAAHH!!

			ANSHOU
Go away!!
	[SND: Energy burst]

			RYOKO
ARGH-OOF!
	[SND: Ryoko smacks the wall]

			ANSHOU
Ah, I see I have an audience.  You got here just in time!  The show is almost
over!
			AEKA
TENCHI!

			RYOKO
Stay back!  If I couldn't touch him, think what he'll do to you!

[SND:  Anshou and Tenchi fight.]

			AEKA (quietly)
We'll have to attack him together.

			JORAN (quietly)
I don't know if four-on-one will be enough.  Father's very powerful.  More
importantly, I doubt the ship could take the beating.  This is the main power
area, where Sujahoh's roots are connected to the turbines.  One wrong move,
and boom!
			ANSHOU
What's the matter, boy?  Aren't you the one who killed Kagato?  I'm not as
powerful as Kagato, and you're barely giving me a good fight!

			TENCHI
I don't... want to... kill you.

			ANSHOU
Well, that's too bad, because I most certainly want to kill *you*.  Make a
decision, boy.  You or me.

			JORAN (quietly)
We need a distraction.  Something to get all of Father's power focused in
one area.
			RYOKO
I know something that would do that, but Tenchi can't seem to pull it off...

			AEKA
I know what to do!  TENCHI!!!

			ANSHOU
This is it, boy.  Prepare to meet whatever gods you Earth people worship!

			AEKA
NOO!!!!

			ANSHOU
Get out of the way, Princess!

			AEKA
I will not!  If you want to kill Tenchi, you'll have to kill me as well!

			ANSHOU
Very well!

			JORAN
Father, no!!

			ANSHOU
She has a sister.  We don't need her!  DIE!!

			TENCHI
NO!!!!

[SND: Energy blast!  Something deflects it!   A humming sound...]

			ANSHOU
Lighthawk wings...  Y-you deflected my blast with lighthawk wings...  I won't
have it.  I will not be defeated by you!  I WILL NOT!!

			JORAN
Here it comes...

			ANSHOU
DIEEE!!!!

			JORAN
NOW!!

[SND: Simultaneous energy attacks]

			ANSHOU
ARRRRRRGGGHH!
	[SND: Thud as he hits the floor]
(pant) What...

			JORAN
Don't move, Father.

			ANSHOU
Joran, my son... why?

			JORAN
Did you think so little of me, Father?  Did you truly believe I would want to
become emperor through such dishonorable treachery?  You yourself taught me
better than that.

			ANSHOU (anguished)
But... But it's your *birthright*, Joran!

			JORAN
You mean yours.
	[pause]
This has always been about you, Father, not me.  I've always been satisfied
with my station in life.  But you've allowed bitterness and disappointment
to ruin yours.
			ANSHOU
How dare you talk to me like that?!  I am your Father!  Ashino!  Kunuzake!

[SND: Ashino & Kunuzake teleport in]

			ASHINO & KUNUZAKE
Sir!

			ANSHOU
Defend me!!

			JORAN
Belay that!  Take my father into custody.

			ASHINO & KUNUZAKE
Yes, sir!

			ANSHOU (stunned)
What?

			JORAN
You've forgotten, Father.  This is *my* ship.

			ANSHOU
No.   NOOOOOOOO--
	[His voice is cut off as he is drawn inside the guardian.]

			JORAN
Keep him in stasis until we return to Jurai.  Lord Tenchi.  I don't know to
say, other than that I apologize.

			TENCHI
(laughs) Don't worry about it.  I'm just glad it's over.

			RYOKO (singsong)
Ohhh, Tenchiii?

			TENCHI (nervously)
Yes?

			RYOKO
I believe you promised me something?

			TENCHI
Oh, heh-heh, that!  Yes, well, maybe we could discuss it later?

			RYOKO
Later?  You wouldn't try to welch on me, would you, Tenchi?

			TENCHI
Of course not, but-- No, wait!  Just a minute!  I'm not ready!  I--!

[SND: Struggling]
			RYOKO
Just relax!

[SND: Small kiss]
			TENCHI
That's it?

			AEKA
You promised her a kiss on the cheek?

			RYOKO
If you must know Princess, I blackmailed him.  So if you have to be angry, you
can be angry at me!

			AEKA
Hmph!  Being angry with you is not difficult!  Besides, I rather figured
you'd forced him into it.

[SND: Joran laughs]
			AEKA & RYOKO
What?!

			JORAN
Oh, nothing.  I'm just beginning to understand the "complications" Aeka
spoke of.  You're a lucky man, Lord Tenchi, whether you know it or not.
Now, if you'll ask your policewoman friend to cut my ship loose, I'll take
my leave.

			TENCHI
Sure.  No problem!

			JORAN
Ashino, Kunuzake, lead them to the transport chamber.  Aeka, could you stay
with me for a moment?

			AEKA
Well, I...

			RYOKO
Oh, don't worry about us.  We'll be fine!  C'mon, Tenchi!

			JORAN
Aeka, I need to ask a favor.  It's about my father.

			AEKA
I understand, Joran.  No one on Jurai will be told what happened.

			JORAN
Thank you.  I know what he did was traitorous, but he's still my father.  I'd
like to deal with this within the family.

			AEKA
He's still my uncle.  I can't believe he was willing to kill me...

			JORAN
I pray that I never become that bitter.

			AEKA
You won't, Joran.  Not you.
	[pause]
Oh!  The Star of Jurai.  I'm still wearing it!  Here--

			JORAN
No, you keep it.

			AEKA
But it means so much to your family.

			JORAN
The next time you see your father, return the Star to him.  Tell him that I
release him from his promise.  If he so wishes, he can give it to me once
again.
			AEKA
I understand.  I should join the others.

			JORAN
Farewell, Aeka.

			AEKA
Farewell, Joran.

[pause as Aeka leaves]
			JORAN (quietly)
Farewell, for now.  But if Tenchi won't make you happy, I'll return for you.

			SASAMI (narrating)
And so Tenchi, Aeka, Ryoko, and Mihoshi returned home.  And for awhile, it was
actually quiet!  Ryoko and Aeka made every effort to be nice to each other and
to live together in peace.  That lasted for a couple of days, then they were
right back at each other's throats.  Actually, I was relieved.  Seeing Aeka
and Ryoko being polite to each other was kinda creepy.  So, anyway,
everything's back to normal at Tenchi's house!  But I'm sure there will be
more adventures soon.  Until then, this is Sasami, signing off!
