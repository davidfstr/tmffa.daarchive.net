Breakfast the next morning went practically the same, except for the fight with Ayeka and Ryoko. 
Kiyone kept looking at her blonde-haired friend with a mixture of pity and anguish.

<I’ve got to say something, but what?!?>

Mihoshi looked quizzically at her partner. "What’s wrong Kiyone?"

Kiyone, feeling as she’d been caught, blushed and looked away quickly. "N-nothing Mihoshi, don’t 
worry about it." <Why am I so nervous? I have to get over this!> 

Mihoshi looked down at her food, feeling ashamed. <If I don't tell her, I'll never get over this!>

Alas, they both sat in silence...

Sasami felt the uncomfortable silence between them and decided to cheer up the mood a bit. 
"So, how was the Karaoke bar last night?"

Mihoshi looked to her, smiling. "It was great, we got a standing ovation and everything!"

Kiyone mumbled quietly, "Yeah, yeah it was fun..."

Sasami looked questioningly at Kiyone, "What's wrong, Kiyone? I thought you liked to sing 
Karaoke?"

Kiyone forced a smile. "I do, Sasami. I just didn't get much sleep last night, that's all."

Washu looked at her quizzically. <Hmmm...I wonder...nah!> She resumed her silent meal. 

Mihoshi began to hum again, Kiyone's sorrowful exposition turned gradually into a grin. Mihoshi 
was pleased by the results.

Patrol had, once again, gone fairly uneventful. Only a few minor arrests were made and there had 
been no real struggle. 

"Five minutes till quitting time." Came a high-pitched, child-like voice. 

Kiyone smiled warmly, like a mother would to her children. "I know, Mihoshi. Do you have to keep 
time?" 

Mihoshi blushed. "Don't blame me for being enthusiastic!", She said jokingly.

Kiyone's smile broadened, "Really? Then who should I blame?"

They both shared a gentle laugh.

Then Mihoshi regained her composure and looked seriously at her partner. "Kiyone...how do you 
feel about me."

Kiyone too, straitened up and gazed somberly at Mihoshi, "W-what do you mean by that?" She 
felt cold sweat begin to coat her back and her face grow warm. 

Mihoshi blushed and looked down in embarrassment, "N-never mind, Kiyone...It doesn't matter."

Kiyone sat up and placed a hand on Mihoshi's arm instinctively. "No, it does matter...I..." She 
replayed the scene in her head. <I like you, Mihoshi. You're my best friend. I don't hate you...don't 
think I do! Please, I love...> She stopped herself, mid-thought. <I didn't think that...no, of course I 
didn't! I was just nervous about the night before, yes that's it!> She noticed Mihoshi's big blue 
eye's staring straight at her. "I like you, Mihoshi...you're a great friend."

Mihoshi melted with joy upon hearing that. Tears began to flow steadily down her face, she wiped 
them away and sniffled a bit. "Y-you mean that, Kiyone?" 

Kiyone nodded. <Thank Kami-sama that's _all_ I said!>

Mihoshi jumped up and grabbed her arms, pulling her into a backbreaking hug. Kiyone didn't 
mind though. She liked the feeling of the blonde bombshell's chest against her... Her eyes 
popped open, <HOLY SHIT!!!> Without thinking she threw Mihoshi away from her, shouting 
obscenities, "What the hell were you doing, what's wrong with you?!? How could you grab me like 
that? Two girls don't do that!!! Why did you-" 

The look on Mihoshi's face stopped her then and there. It was a look you didn't see often; one of 
hurt, fear, anger, loss and betrayal all at once. It set a shiver straight through her soul and set her 
blood to Arctic. She tried to speak but was suddenly cut off by the force of Mihoshi's palm against 
her cheek. Kiyone, until that moment, had never realized how strong Mihoshi actually was. Let's 
put it this way; think of the force of a large van, traveling at top speed, crammed into the space of 
about 24 square inches. It sent Kiyone sprawling to the floor, but none of this hurt compared to 
the look on Mihoshi's face. 

Kiyone tried to lift her head, she felt a loose molar, but didn’t care; She could grow a new one 
(she is an alien), she couldn’t get a new Mihoshi. Her stomach wrenched. Her heart burned. But 
Mihoshi looked worse. 

Her blonde-haired partner stared at her with searing hate. "How...?", She asked quietly, "How 
could you be so cold? How could you hate me so? AFTER ALL I'VE TRIED FOR YOU!!!" She 
stormed out of the room, leaving a clear trail of tears behind her. 

Tears sprang from Kiyone's eyes as well. "What have I done...?"

Mihoshi

The only thing Mihoshi knew right now, was hate. Hate for Kiyone? Hate for herself? She didn't 
know. The only thing she could feel inside her was a searing hate. 

She clutched a picture of Kiyone to her chest. <How could she be so cruel? How could _I_ be so 
cruel?> She sniffled and wiped a few tears away. "Why does it hurt so much...?", She asked to no 
one in particular. <I should go talk to her...no, she probably loathes my existence by now...> She 
let out a deep sigh. <But staying here isn't doing much...Oh, I wish I could think straight! Kiyone's 
so smart...she'd know what to do.> She cried into her arms, "Please don't hate me Kiyone, I'm 
nothing without you!" She lay quietly in a fetal position. 

A knock came on the door. 

Mihoshi didn't twitch.

"M-Mihoshi? Mihoshi a-are you in there?" Kiyone's voice wavered with a mixture of fear and pity. 

Mihoshi's only response was a soft whimper. 

"Mihoshi...please forgive me...I-I didn't mean to say those things."

Mihoshi lifted her head up enough to say, "Well, you did." Then she laid it back down...

Kiyone's tears dripped slowly down onto her uniform, creating small streams of them. <Oh, Kami-
sama, why! Why did I have to be so mean?!?> She banged her fists against the door. Tears 
splattered to the ground. "Why...?", she whispered softly.

She slid slowly down the door until her knees hit the floor. She fell into a fetal position on the 
ground.

So, what do you think. Kind of short and sad, huh? Well, deal with it! The next few chapters will 
be all sugarcoated and happy for all you Toonami lovers out there. >p

Aaron: *Sigh*
