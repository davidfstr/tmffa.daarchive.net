The Song of My Heart

	It was a cool spring day. It had been 5 years since Yugi's apearence, 5 
long years.  Sasami was 15 now,  and she hoped her friend Yugi would wake up 
soon.  I Ryoko, hadn't been the same since Yugi's attack....  I never will be... 
Tenchi, you broke my heart,  and forever that crack will remain... Hotsuma... I 
thought we were friends.... and it was my secret that deep down,  I had been in 
love with him.  Even though he betrayed me... I still love him,  but also, I 
still love Tenchi, my heart sings two different songs for two different 
people..... when Yugi awakens, I hope she will bring Hotsuma back... I must tell 
him how I felt, how I feel.
	I saw a light shineing from the shrine.... Yugi had awoken. after I got 
everyone and we ran to the shrine, we saw her standing there smileing.  I'll 
never forget the bright smile Sasami also had,  she was practically glowing with 
happiness,  I suppose I would be too if i saw my friend for the first time in 
five years, and then I noticed it.  Three red orbs floated out of the cave.  I 
smiled knowing what those orbs were, Yugi's friends, Matori, Tsugaru, and 
Hotsuma.  My face lit up when I thought of him, but no one noticed, then the 
orbs turned into human forms,  they were all exactly as we remembered them.

	A week passed, and Yugi and her "friends" had been in Washu's lab all 
week,  she wanted to examine them, make sure the evil was out of them, and get 
certain samples that I won't go into.  Washu finally came out with a somber 
look.
"Whats wrong?" asked sasami, her voice sounded very worried.
"They're all ok... exept one...." Washu replyed "The blonde one, Hotsuma."
{oh no...} I thought

It was late, but I couldn't sleep.  I couldn't stop thinking of him, his face, 
his voice, his touch.... yet.. yet he was evil.  Tenchi.... he wasn't evil but 
he I was almost sure was in love with ayeka, otherwise his heart was still held 
by Sakuya.  Suddenly I was startled by the sound of a door opening.  i went into 
the hall to investigate, but i saw nothing, I levetated so I wouldn't make 
noise, and flew downstairs, thats when I saw it, Hotsuma running tword the 
woods....

"Damnit!" Ryoko yelled, as she flew out the dor after him.
	Ryoko's yell woke up the household, so they went downstairs to see what 
was going on.  They saw Ryoko flying after Hotsuma at high speed, Yugi, knowing 
why due to her phycic power, smiled, which Sasami to look at her questioningly.
"Yugi, why are you smileing like that?" Sasami asked.
"Oh, no reason.." Yugi replyed. "No reason at all..." she whispered as she 
walked back up to the room she was shareing with Sasami.
"Should we go after her?" Tenchi asked quietly.
"No... Just let her do what she must." Yugi replyed before she walked up the 
stairs and back to the room.

Ryoko flew quickly after Hotsuma,  she knew she could change him... change him 
to be all good, but she had to catch him and get him to come back first, then 
she had an idea. She searched the ground and found a large rock,  then 
teleported behind a tree the way he was heading, she waited there then just 
before he passed,  she dropped the rock over his head knocking him out.  
"Phew... let's go..." she said as she grabbed the colar of his shirt and dragged 
him back. "Only for love...." she whispered and smiled to herself as she came 
out of the woods and headed back to the house.
