Once upon a time there was a boy who loved the world, who loved everything it 
had to offer. The boy had no regrets, fears, or anything else that might trouble him. 
He was filled with joy and peace. Until the day his father was revealed to be 
something else, something that the boy did not understand. For years he lived with his 
mother and his father, without a care in the world. For years he lived a lie. His father 
turned out to be a man who had many secrets. It wasn't until the boy himself started 
to change, that he started to become like his father, that his dad's true colors were 
shown.

It was a regular day when it happened. It was my 15th birthday. I had been running 
in the fields outside my parent's cottage. It was a humble home on top of a hill, with a 
white picket fence, and a flower garden. It was a place of dreams. I was playing and 
laughing and loving the world just as I always had, and then I fell. I fell into a world of 
new feelings and sensations that I could never have conceived. I had visions of the 
future and the past, and all in between. I was scared of what I saw, and the fear 
caused me to scream with all the air I had inside me. When I returned from my 
delusions I awoke to find that I was not the same as before. My body ached and 
twisted to form something different. Inside me slept a giant force; that had just been 
awakened. When it was all done I looked at myself in awe. I had transformed into a 
new man, my muscles were enormous and I felt a strength that I had never known. 
My power had finally manifested itself. 

After it had happened, suspicion to where I had gotten these new "gifts" arose. It 
wasn't long until it was traced to my father. I knew him by a human name, but the 
universe new him by another. Throughout the galaxy there was a name that was 
feared above all others, it was a name of a vicious monster of a criminal. Who saw 
himself as the ruler of all life, who saw himself as God.  This man's name was King 
Diablo; this man was my father. The monster was rumored to have gone on some 
kind of vacation, for he had not been seen for at least 16 years. Well, now I know 
where he's been.

	Tenchi Masaki had just come home from school. He was walking down 
the winding road to his house when Ryoko jumped him. She tackled him to the 
ground and hugged him with glee. Tenchi wasn't so thrilled about the situation, but 
still, he would miss it if it didn't happen. Soon came Ayeka, running as fast as she 
could while wearing one of her kimonos.

"Lord Tenchi! Lord Tenchi" she called until she got close enough to see Ryoko. " 
Ryoko let go of him this instant!" she shouted.

" Relax princess, I'm just giving him a hug, is that so wrong?" as she said this her 
hands started to move towards Tenchi's more personal areas.

" It is when you do that! Now get off!" Ayeka demanded.

" Oh but I am getting off, and I think Tenchi is too!" Ryoko said playfully.

" Ryoko! Stop it!" Tenchi blurted out.

" But Tenchi don't you like it when I do this to you? I know you do." Ryoko was 
being seductive now.

" That's Enough!" Ayeka screamed!  

	But before anyone could say another word they heard a loud noise like an 
explosion coming from the sky, fallowed by a sound like something was falling.

" Mihoshi?" said Tenchi

It was than that the falling object came into view. It was like a bright comet with a 
green tail. It hit the earth with a huge impact. Making a crater not far from Tenchi's 
grandfather's shrine. The three of them got up and began to run to the site. On the 
way they met the others who had also heard the large blast. When they all got there 
they saw a massive crater but they couldn't make out what was inside it. The smoke 
and dust was still too thick to see through. They waited until it cleared and were 
amazed by what they saw; inside the crater wasn't a meteorite, wasn't a space ship 
or some other object that you would think would make this. It was a man. Shielded 
by nothing more than the tattered clothes on his wore. What was perhaps even more 
amazing was that the man was not only still intact, but conscious! He was trying to get 
up, but he couldn't find the strength, and fell down. He lay there looking up at the sky 
from which he fell and inside a part of him died. He tried to get up again, gut again he 
fell. Then Ryoko appeared above him like an angel from heaven, she reached out 
with her hand, mentioning that he should take, and the he reached out with his and 
grabbed a hold of hers. Ryoko lifted him up and pulled him out of the crater. She 
placed him down against a tree were he was in a sitting up position. 

" Are you alright?" Ryoko said with concern. 

The man did not reply. He looked at her, and then at the rest. He was wearing all 
black, a regular long sleeved shirt and a pair of pants that fit him loosely. His face 
was partially covered by two black bangs that hung over his forehead. On top of his 
head was spiked red hair. He looked at them all with piercing green eyes and said 
nothing. A few awkward moments of silence passed until he finally succumbed to the 
pain and fell into unconsciousness. 

" What do we do now? He blacked out!" Ayeka questioned.

" We can't just leave him!" Tenchi said.

"Take him to my lab, I'll take care of him there." said Washu. 

	Ryoko picked up the man in black and carried him all the way to the house 
and put him down in Washu's laboratory.  No one knew a thing about this man, they 
didn't know if he was hear on accident because he was attacked or if he was there 
as an enemy. All they knew was that he was hurt and that he needed their help. And 
they were damned sure he was gonna' get it.

Author's note- That's chapter 1, I hope you stay tuned for what happens next. 
And in case you haven't figured it out, the boy in the first paragraphs is the same guy 
who was in the crater.
