No Need for a Test
by "Little Washu" or Clare

Prologue

	Tenchi came home after harvesting carrots to find Ryoko and Ayeka standing 
by the door to 
greet him. Ryoko had an evil grin on her face and Ayeka had her petite nose up 
in the air.
	"Hello dear Tenchi," Ayeka spoke in a soft sweet voice.
	"Hey Tenchiii!" Ryoko glomped onto Tenchi.
	"Ryoko! You devil-woman! Get off my Tenchi NOW!" Ayeka roared.
	Ryoko ignored Ayeka and with her arms wrapped around Tenchi's neck she 
purred, "Tenchi,
Hon, do you like me or that little brat?"
	Tenchi tried to move his face so Ryoko wouldn't breathe on him and 
replied," I do
not know."
	Ryoko angrily got down, kicking Tenchi in the shin along the way.
	"Ow!" Tenchi yelped.
	While Ryoko teleported away, Ayeka ran over to Tenchi, "Oh my, Tenchi 
darling! Are you ok?"
	Tenchi just nodded and limped away.

	"Tenchi! Tenchi!" Yosho hollered. "Where is that boy?"
	Tenchi ran over to his grandpa who stood impatiently against a tree.
	"You're late boy," Yosho complained.
	"Sorry, it's nearly impossible to get out of the house with the 6 girls 
staying here."
	Yosho took out a sword and handed it to Tenchi, then pulled out one for 
himself.
	"Alright, give it your best shot," Yosho commanded.
	"Arghhhhhhhhhhhh!" Tenchi, with the sword in his hands, dashed towards his 
grandpa.
	Tenchi didn't get much closer than 3 feet away from Yosho. First crown 
prince of Jurai's
skills are still in good tact; not a bit rusty.
	"Try harder boy!" Yosho snapped.
	"Errrr...oof!" Tenchi collapsed on the ground from the force of Yosho's 
sword.
	"Keep practicing. We'll try again tomorrow," and with that, Yosho walked 
away.
	Tenchi took a moment to catch his breath. Everything in his life was 
getting so
complicated. As if training and school wasn't bad enough already, He had 6 
beautiful women wanting his attention. They wanted him to love them. Them as the 
center of his universe.
	He thought a moment about what happened when he got home from the carrot 
fields that
morning. Ayeka and Ryoko didn't act differently, but somehow he felt he had to 
make a decision.
One that could hurt the other 5 girls, one that could maybe be the wrong one and 
be too late to
change it, one he dreaded of even thinking about. But he knew it was time to 
grow up and act like
a man. He wanted a girl who would respect his decisions, but how could he find 
who that one is?

	Tenchi and Amagasaki walked together towards the buses.
	"Hey, did you see the new girl? I think she digs me!" Amagasaki sounded 
like a child who was going to the candy store.
	"M-hmm," Tenchi just continued thinking about a plan to find his girl.
	"Tenchi? You alright?" Amagasaki stood in front of Tenchi stopping him. 
"Get a hold of 
yourself."
	Tenchi shook his thoughts out of his head so he could think straight about 
what was currently
going on. "Sorry Amagasaki, I just have a lot on my mind."
	"Who's the lucky girl?" Amagasaki grinned
	"WHO SAID IT WAS A GIRL!?" Tenchi screamed.
	"Uh, sorry man," Amagasaki apologized.
	The boys climbed onto the bus and took their seat. Tenchi was almost ready 
to start yanking his hair out.
I'm going crazy! He thought. Maybe I shouldn't decide. Things are just fine the 
way they are.
He knew that was a lie.

	Sasami opened the door to Tenchi's bedroom. Tenchi was sitting at his 
desk, his nose in the books.
"Hiya Tenchi!" Sasami chirped. "Dinner's almost ready!"
	Tenchi glanced at his watch. Was it that late already? He had been so busy 
doing his homework and thinking about his problem, he lost track of time.
	"I'll be right down, Sasami, thanks." Tenchi said.
Tenchi moaned as he closed the books. He wasn't ready to be around the girls. 
Not yet. Not without a plan, but he went downstairs anyways and sat at the end 
of the table.
	"Hi Tenchi," Mihoshi waved at him.
	"Uh.hi."
	Mihoshi was certainly a silly girl, clumsy, in that matter. Although 
attractive, Tenchi never really thought she would be marriage material. Not yet 
at least. Maybe when she stops watching cartoons with Sasami or reading teen 
magazines, but right now, he thought of her as a friend and only a friend.
	Sasami carried over plates full of food to each setting just as Washu came 
out of her lab.
	"Looks good Sasami! I'm starving!" Washu sat at the opposite end of Tenchi 
and began to eat in tiny nibbles.
	Tenchi was certainly amused by Washu. It isn't everyday you meet a 20,000 
year old in a 12-year old body, or a 20,000 year old at all. But, Washu had 
reasons to hide from her true age. Being an adult seemed to be something 
negative. Most people look forward to becoming an adult. Move out from your 
parent's house, get a real job, raise a family, no rules, but Washu's adulthood 
was extremely rough. Her husband was taken away. Tenchi could see that she was 
lonely, and still was,
	"Good evening Washu," Tenchi forced himself to say.
	"Oh. Hi Tenchi," Washu cutely smiled.
	Ryoko came into the room next and winked at Tenchi while taking her seat.
	"Hey, Sasami, where's my sake?!" Ryoko asked.
	"It's coming," Sasami said in an annoyed voice.
	"You know you shouldn't drink sake all the time Ryoko, it's not healthy," 
Ayeka informed Ryoko.
	"Yeah, whatever. You should lighten up a bit and try it sometime," Ryoko 
insisted.
	"No way!"
	Tenchi sighed. Soon this will be over. Or would it be worse? His plan has 
to be effective, but not too harmful.
	"Tenchi?" Ayeka stared at Tenchi with concern.
	"Oh..oh man." Tenchi banged his head on the table. "Ugh, lost in thought 
again!"
	Ayeka looked at Tenchi and smiled, "Can I please talk to you for a 
moment?"
	Ayeka and Tenchi walked through the forest for a little while before Ayeka 
stopped.
	"Tenchi, I love you with all my heart. I used to think that if I could not 
be the bride of Yosho, that I could never love anyone else. I proved to be 
wrong. I just ask one thing, do you love me?" Ayeka's eyes shined in hope.
	Tenchi studied her for a few moments then got a plan, "Ayeka. I don't know 
how to say this, but right now my heart belongs to Ryoko."
	Ayeka's cheerful face dramatically changed to horror, "You WHAT?! How dare 
you like that monster!"
	Ayeka ran back towards the house and Tenchi followed closely behind. Ayeka 
went inside the house and came back out dragging Sasami with her.
	"What are you doing?" Tenchi asked in shock.
	"We are going back to Jurai. I do not want to see your face again! You-you 
filthy earthling!" Ayeka cried.
	Tenchi would stop her from leaving, but couldn't. If Ayeka could not 
respect his choice, then everyday would be a living hell. He knew Ayeka was not 
the one he was meant to be with, so he let her and Sasami head back to their 
home planet.
	"No! I don't want to go!" Sasami yelled, but her sister continued to drag 
her.
	Tenchi looked at Sasami with sympathy. He never thought that Ayeka would 
leave. And besides that, take Sasami with her.

Tenchi slowly walked back inside. Ryoko walked up to Tenchi and embraced him.
	"Hey Tenchi! Did that princess bother you? I can take care of her for 
you," Ryoko offered.
	"No! Look Ryoko," Tenchi gulped as he continued his plan. "I just told 
Ayeka that I loved her. I, well, I was just worried how you would feel."
	Ryoko burst into tears, "How can someone love Ayeka? She's spoiled. She 
has nothing to offer you! I on the other hand, would satisfy you! Just change 
your mind!"
	Tenchi shook his head, "Ryoko, no. She's heading to Jurai to get prepared 
for our..our wedding."
	By then Ryoko was angry. "Wedding?! Since when did you propose?!"
	"Uh..just before I came in?" Tenchi said uneasily.
	Ryoko glared a Tenchi, "Then don't you dare come crawling back when the 
marriage doesn't work out! The only shoulder you'll have to cry on is your own, 
and wherever I am, I'll be laughing."
	With that, Ryoko disappeared.
	Well, that went well, Tenchi thought. At least I know I'm not destined to 
be with either of them.
	Tenchi decided to talk to Mihoshi and Kiyone at the same time.
	The two were watching a soap opera in the living room.
	"Ahem," Tenchi cleared his throat, catching both girls' attention.
	"Hey Tenchi," Kiyone smiled.
	"Hi. I just proposed to Ryoko," Tenchi announced.
	"What?!" Kiyone and Mihoshi exclaimed.
	"You'd think you'd be smart enough not to marry a criminal!" Kiyone 
snapped.
	"Yeah, I guess I would," Tenchi replied sarcastically.
	Mihoshi began to cry.
	"Don't cry Mihoshi," Tenchi cooed.
	"She has every right to! Our friend has turned to the dark side"
	Mihoshi was sniffling but managed to say, "Don't take it too personally 
when we have to arrest you two."
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
	
Tenchi was getting worried now. So far none of the girls respected his choice. 
The only person left was: Washu. If she doesn't respect his decision, he would 
not only be without a girlfriend, but without a friend as well. He had driven 
the other 5 away. This was his only hope.
	Tenchi knocked lightly on Washu's lab door.
	"Who is it?" Washu asked.
	"It's me Washu," Tenchi said loudly enough so Washu could hear through her 
metal door.
	"Come on in Tenchi!" Washu said with a happy tone.
	Tenchi walked in and saw the redhead typing on her holographic computer. 
"I just wanted to inform you that I just announced that I love Ayeka."
	Washu stopped typing and her head hung down. Was she angry? Disappointed? 
Happy? She turned around and looked Tenchi in the eyes. Sure enough, there was 
hurt.
	Washu forced a smile, "Well, congrats. I wish you two are happy.together."
	The only noise after that was a sigh from Washu, then was the awkward 
silence, but Tenchi was happy.. She had respected his decision! She was willing 
to accept it. Plus, he knew she loved him because he did see the disappointment 
in her eyes.
	Tenchi ran up and Washu and hugged her. He finally got up and noticed 
Washu looking at him confused. Now I tell her that I love her! But Tenchi 
stopped. He thought his plan was perfect, only what would Washu think when she 
hears he lied? That this was all a test? The others would be furious! He 
couldn't not tell her, or she would think he was trying to cheat on Ayeka, and 
he was certain Washu wouldn't be a part of that.
	"Washu?" Tenchi began. "I, don't know how to say this, but, I didn't tell 
Ayeka I loved her."
	"What?" Washu was puzzled, which was unusual for her, the greatest 
scientific genius of the universe.
	"What I'm trying to say is, that I made a test. A test to see who I could 
love. That test was to see who would respect me and my decisions."
	Washu nodded.
	"Well, things didn't go to hot with Ayeka. Ryoko was really pissed, 
Mihoshi and Kiyone didn't accept my decision either, Only you did. You cared 
enough that you wished that I would be happy, even if it meant your heart 
breaks. Ayeka just insulted me, Ryoko thought the marriage would be unhappy and 
that she'll laugh when it ends, and Mihoshi and Kiyone threatened to arrest me. 
Although I have liked the others, I was very intrigued by you. I believe you 
need someone more than any of the others. Sasami and Ayeka have each other, plus 
a planet to rule. Ryoko, well, she has space pirate buddies, and Mihoshi and 
Kiyone are partners and have their careers, but you don't have anyone. I'm glad 
that you are the one that respected me."
	Washu stared at Tenchi for a moment, making Tenchi afraid Washu would get 
really mad and use him as a test subject for a dangerous experiment, but she 
smiled at him.
	"Tenchi, I always respected you and trusted you. I'm guessing you'd do the 
same?"
	"Of course!" Tenchi exclaimed.
	"Good! Now can we get that last sample I wanted?" Washu asked with an 
innocent tone.
	"Uh.."
	The next second later Washu was in her adult form wearing her nurse outfit 
with a glove on her hands. Tenchi was trapped by one of Washu's other 
inventions.
	Washu smiled, "Okay, honey, let's see what you've got!"
