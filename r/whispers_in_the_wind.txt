This is a fairly dark and tragic story written by me. 
Tenchi Muyo belongs to AIC and Pioneer, probably others 
as well, blah, blah, blah... Anyway, on with the story. 
Don't get me wrong, I am a GREAT Ryoko fan. I think I'm 
even obsessed in seeing Tenchi confess his love to her. 
But, this just happen to be a story for GenSao's Ayeka 
Challenge. 

WHISPERS IN THE WIND
by Asa Negaverse (Yaoli Pu)

    Rain... soothing and angry, crying and laughing.
Ryoko sat by the cave, hands on her lap. Wind... quiet 
and soft, loud and impulsive. 
    <FLASH!> We see Zero Ryoko in the arms of Tenchi.
    "That's all I want to be... Ryoko" She said, feeling
his warmth, snuggling closer to him, sharing the rich gentle
brightness of his soul, and of his quiet strength.
    <FLASH!> We see little Tenchi crying by the cave, 
crystal clear tears drizzled down his soft cheeks. He 
couldn't see Ryoko, couldn't see her face, filled with
love. She placed a ghosty hand on top of his head, trying
to comfort him. 
    <FLASH!> We see Tenchi, now a man, walking by the 
cave, his wooden sword in hand. He smiled a wistful and
misty smile, recalling his old "headquarters". However,
he missed the sad frown on Ryoko's astral form.
    <FLASH!> We see Ryoko clutching Tenchi's bloodied
scarf close to her breast, crying hysterically. 
    <FLASH!> We see the determined face of Tenchi as he
battled Kagato, attacking in rage at the man who hurted
Ryoko, someone he cares about deeply.
    'Oh, Tenchi... Why must you choose Ayeka?' She 
thought, sighing inwardly, lowering her head. The wind 
blew, gentle this time, ruffling her hair. It whispered,
softly at first, then louder.
    <FLASH!> We see Ryoko sobbing, seeing Ayeka and Tenchi,
tears streaming down her face. She ran, despite the rain.
Tenchi followed her, struggling to catch up. She sobbed
until she hiccuped, until her vision blurred to one dark
blob. She ran, until her legs were numb. She tripped over
a rock, landing with a sick dull thud, her ankle twisted and
starting to swell. But she didn't care. Ryoko couldn't feel 
her pain anymore. All she could do is run.
    The wind continues to whisper, the words slurred and
unfamiliar, but yet the message is so simple, so clear. It 
held comfort to her. The demon warrior let out a deep breath.
She thought about her long life, a life longer that any
human or Juraian. 
    She remembered her birth, in a dark and cloudy lab,
no sign of life forms. She remembered peering into the
face of Kagato, her master. She remembered the beatings
she took each time she failed to obey. She had no mother,
unless you count on that brat Washu (this is Ryoko's 
opinion, not mine. I actually think Washu's cool). 
She had no childhood, no friends. Only Ryo-ohki, her
faithful cabbit could understand her, and her pain in
life. Everyone considers her a murderer, even Tenchi at 
first.
     'Tenchi...' She thought, a dreamy smile dawning upon
her dirt streaked face. She remember clearly the day, when
he was only five, when he could still have the ability to 
see her, came and asked if they could get married. It was
a childish question, and she was flattered as he went on 
about how pretty she is. He promised her! He promised her 
they would get married someday, but now he is with Ayeka...
     He was so handsome, the way his brown eyes light up 
with inner amusement and slight irkiness whenever she would 
glomp onto him. Maybe that was wrong... she was so
inexperience, never loving anyone before, that she just 
assumed that the way to a man's heart is by glomping. She
was wrong. Ayeka had won, hasn't she? 
     'Tenchi...' The wind seems to whisper, voice low and
moarnful, mirroring Ryoko's broken heart. She placed her
hands on her face and cried some more.
     'A never-ending carnival... what a joke.' She thought
sadly, tears streaming down her face, like a soft waterfall.
But the carnival had ended, with Tenchi and Ayeka living
happily. There was no space for a demon. Demons don't get
the hero, the princess does. No, dreaded pirates die. They
always have, and always will. She laughed bitterly. She
was so naive, so foolish, to think that Tenchi would love
a dreaded space pirate like her... How couldn't she had
seen this coming? Surely Ayeka will win. She was of noble
family, rich, polite, a wife who obeys. She was perfect.
She has a calm disposition, and can sucessfully raise a
children.
     It is apparent that she is best for Tenchi, not
Ryoko. Who would want to marry the most wanted space
pirate anyway? Certainly not Tenchi. He deserves better.
He deserves more. Things that Ryoko could not give to him.
She wasn't even sure if her body is compatible with
his for children, something he would have wished to have.
     How could she had not seen this coming? She asked to
herself once more. Because she was blinded by love and
hope...
     Ryoko stared at her dark surroundings. When she was
still imprisoned, people had called it a 'tomb'. Well,
how right they are! This is a tomb, or rather, will be
a tomb. Squinting back more tears, Ryoko spat in fury.
She wished she had never met Tenchi, or Ayeka, or anyone
on this damn planet. She'd then be freed from the pain.
Her heart ached as she held out a blade. It was made of 
silver, with a graceful handle of pure jade. Ryoko
shivered. She teased herself about her fear of death.
Hadn't Washu programmed her to be unafraid of it?
Yup, that was all she is, a creation, a monster programed
by a mad scientist. 
     She mustn't be afraid. She must do this... But she
still shivered, her heart filled with stupid hope. Maybe
it was all a dream? Maybe she would wake up any second 
now to see Tenchi smiling down at her, holding her close.
But it wasn't. The truth sank in. She stared at the blade,
reflecting the warm pale glow of the moon. She mustn't
be afraid. She must be the brave fearless space pirate 
she was created to be. She lived a long life of 5,000 
years. So why was she afraid? Because of her hope, blinding
her once again. No, she must crush that hope. There was
no hope, only despair. Ryoko had honor. She's not going
back there, like a dog with it's tail between it's legs.
She's going to stick to her goal. If only...
     Ryoko's stomach churned at the thought of going
back. How can she face everybody? Yosho will probably
give her some calm advice, and Sasami, sweet little
Sasami will cry and hug her. Mihoshi will be worried, only
to forget everything in a matter of seconds. Washu will...
do tests probably, Ryoko thought with sarcasm. Tenchi
will stare at her with his kind eyes and apologize, trying
to make everything better and have her be friends with 
Ayeka... And Ayeka, well, she will probably put on a 
concern face, looking at her with pity.
     She doesn't need pity. She needs love. More accuratly,
Tenchi's love. Sadly, she turned to her knife. She breathed
deeply, reasuring herself that maybe she'll actually make
it to heaven. Maybe... then, she'll wake up. Maybe by 
killing herself, she ended one life, and was in another.
Maybe in that life, she'll have Tenchi...
     She held out the blade in trembling hands. She must
act quickly, for she's starting to hear the soft crunching
of sneakers. She used to adore that sound, but now she
resented it. It will make her crack, and abandon her goal.
She must be hard. She must be strong. In a fluid motion,
she impaled it inside her breast. Ryoko didn't feel pain,
only numbness. She felt as she was floating. Her eyelids
fell. So tired... Her brain felt dazed as the last thing
she could see is redness, her own dark crimson fluid.

****
     Tenchi Masaki cradled Ryoko against his body, feeling
her cold skin. With one shaky hand, he place his hand 
against her cold cheek, his hot tears splashed down her
pale face, no longer in their warm golden hue. 'It was
all my fault. I could have done more. Maybe even show her 
love. Maybe I could even love her. It wasn't impossible', 
he thought sadly. Gentally, he bended down and kissed her 
softly on the lips, letting the moment linger. Her lips 
were so soft, so comfortable. Closing his eyes briefly in 
pain, he carried her outside, back home, with the soft wind 
whispering 'Ryoko', quiet and demure, mirroring his sorrow.
 
End?

This is my first dark fiction, so please, be merciful. I hope 
you enjoyed it. The reason I did this fanfiction was that I 
wanted the reader to understand that Ryoko was a proud and 
gental person, not like the tough, cruel person many people 
think she is. Also, to tell the readers why many of us 
writers want Tenchi to be with Ryoko. Isn't it obvious 
that this is excatly what she'll probably do? But in Ayeka's 
case, she'll probably go back to Jurai and be the Emperess. 
In both cases, either woman will go through pain, and I
personally think Ayeka can take it better. So... until 
next time... please send me some feedback!
