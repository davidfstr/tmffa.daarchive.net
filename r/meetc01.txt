Tenchi muyo:tenchi meets crarazel
part I : setting the stage


    The story begins at katsuhito's temple, tenchi,ryoko,ayeka and friends
have just got back from saving achika and destroying kain. Tenchi is a the
near by lake thinking and ryoko is with him.
"Tenchi what are you thinking about?" asked ryoko. "Oh nothing much." tenchi
answers. But he was thinking about hi mother, achika.

    suddenly a warp hole opens above the lake and two men fall out of it and
into the lake. "what the.." says tenchi as looks to see who the men are. the
two men float to the surface and swim to shore near tenchi and ryoko.

     Finaly tenchi got a good look at them, one had light-purple long hair
and was holding a sword and shield that sparkled like a rainbow, the other
man had long white hair and was wearing a necklace that had a beautiful gem
in it.

    "Are you tenchi?" asked the white haired man. "Yes." replayed tenchi.
"well then, I'm Zelos and this is Galin and we're here to help you." said
the white haired man. "Wha..." said tenchi and ryoko almost at the same time
as they wondered what was going on.
