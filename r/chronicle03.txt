Kagato Lives On
Part III of the "Chronicle!" Series
By Greg "Puff-Cloud" Kerby

Chapter 1

	Everyone except Washu, who kept herself cooped up in
her subspace laboratory, sat down at the kabhudai sipping
tea and enjoying a delicious lunch cooked by Sasami as they
listened to Sabi tell his story of the events that had
happened last night.  But Ayeka was beginning to look like
someone a person who had experienced an extremely horrible
nightmare.  The weapons he was describing rang a bell
somewhere in her mind.  The only trouble was... she couldn't
quite figure out what it was.  "Ummmm, Lord Sabi? About the
weapons you were talking about..." she started to speak, but
then hesitated.  Sabi took a sip of his green tea then brought
the cup away from his mouth.  "What about them?" he asked
softly.  "May I see the weapons, that is...if you have them?"
asked the nervous princess.  Sabi proceeded to reach into his
jacket and brought out the two catalysts.  Ayeka dropped her
cup, which shattered into numerous pieces on the table in
front of her

	A figure began to appear inside a small capsule, big
enough for one person to fit inside.  After materializing
in the capsule, a door opened from the pod.  The escaped
prisoner stepped out.   He stretched his body out.
Apparently, he was tired, but that didn't stop him.  The
convict looked around the elaborate room he was in.  "Ah,
just like I had left it.  This place hasn't changed the
slightest bit."  Suddenly, a deep voice filled the entire
room, "Greetings, Lord Sumakka.  I have missed you so much."
A smile appeared on Sumakka's face.  "And I have missed you,
Kunai.  I trust my younger brother has arrived and has been
given the up most respect." replied Sumakka.  "I have done
as you requested, Lord Sumakka.  Kagato arrived three days
ago.  Would you like me to send him to you sir?" asked the
computer.  Sumakka shook his head. "That won't be necessary.
Just tell him that I will meet him on the bridge in 10
minutes.  I am going to my quarters to change into something
more suiting.  Besides... I need to get rid of these rags."

Chapter 2

	Ayeka stood still, her eyes fixed on the katar hilts.
"Th-Those are the J-Jurai K-K-Katars!" she exclaimed, "Then
that means... You are the great-grandson of my assassinated
uncle, Konachi!" she felt weak and fainted onto the floor and
into unconcsiousness.

Tenchi rushed to her side.  "Ayeka, Ayeka!!"  she didn't
respond.  Tenchi gently shook her, but again didn't respond.
He turned his head toward to Sasami "Sasami, go get Washu,
and fast!" said Tenchi.  Tears ran in her eyes as she
ran to the lab.

	Washu was busy at her ethereal laptop putting her
latest scientific theory to the test with her databanks when
Sasami burst in the door.  "WASHU!!!  COME QUICK, IT'S
AYEKA!!!"  Washu fell off of her floating cushion.  "What's
wrong, Sasami?  Is she fighting with Ryoko again?" asked the
young scientist running towards Sasami.  "No, they aren't
fighting.  Just come with me," said Sasami. She grabbed
Washu's wrist and exited the lab.

	Sasami and Washu soon arrived at the scene.  Washu
kneeled at Ayeka's side.  She could feel Ayeka's Jurai
power.  And it was becoming weaker... by the second.  "I've
got to get her into a stabilization containment field fast.
She is losing her Jurai power quickly.  If we don't act
quickly, she'll die."  exclaimed Washu!  Tenchi was becoming
confused about the situation.  It almost drove him to the
point in which he would turn insane.  "Who could be behind
all of this, Little Washu?" cried Tenchi.  Without hesitation,
she turned toward Tenchi, "The only person who could have
done this is Kagato.  Ryoko was shocked at the mention of
the evil name.  "That's impossible!  Tenchi destroyed Kagato
on the Soja!  I even saw him destroy that creep with my own
eyes!  Kagato could never have survived!"  "Ryoko, he
survived." declared Washu, with a calm voice.  "Alright Miss
Smarty, how DID he survive?"  A smirk appeared on Washu's
face.  "I'll tell you how."

A door opened, leading to the ship's bridge, where a tall
figure was standing.  Kagato stared out a view port, where
he could see the Earth from a very small point of view.
"Soon... the power I have sought over these years will
finally be mine.  But that boy will be quite a handful.
No matter... after I have completely absorbed the princess'
Jurai power, I will have the biggest power in the universe,
along with my brother Sumakka.  Then Tenchi will die!"
Kagato suddenly heard a door open.  He turned around to
find no one there.  He turned back around only to have an
energy sword pointed at his throat.  "Wha!" gasped Kagato
as he stepped back.  "Ha!  You always fall for that trick."
cried Sumakka as his energy sword disappeared.  Kagato
grinned. "Is that any way to treat your younger brother?"
he scowled. "Soon, we will arrive at Earth.  Then we will
both get what we have come for.  I want those Katars if it's
the last thing I do!  Who knows what amount of power they
withhold.  The Jurai family will cease to exist once we have
destroyed the ones on the Earth.  They will pay for my
imprisonment!" exclaimed the older villain. "And I will finally
get Tsunami and unlock the power to become immortal. And
then we will both rule the universe." stated Kagato.  "NEXT
STOP... EARTH!!!"
