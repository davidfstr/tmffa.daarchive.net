Most characters in this story are property of AIC and Pioneer.
They are in such a situation solely because of my imagination.
This story was written purely for fun.

This FF is based on the TV Series, with some powers drawn over
from the OAV, but with no Light Hawk Wings.

This story contains no sex, so please do not expect it.

Before I wrote this Fanfic, I have only read 2 Fanfics, Aikan
Muyo and To Love & To Hate. Since then I have read some others,
and have noted some writers have a tendency to portray some
characters inaccurately. I hope I have not fallen into that trap.

DARKNESS & LIGHT - No Need For Kova

                            By Zyraen

Chapter XII : No Need for Communication

They watched, as the Tachyon Blaster held in Seida’s hand
blazed with dark blue energies, gathering power and charging up
with an eerie crackling sound, preparing to unleash its deadly load.

Washu ran towards Aeka, her heart pounding with fear. "Ryoko, help
me!" The bracelet about her right wrist glowed with small golden
lights as the gathering night blue darkness in the distance grew in
intensity.

Pain lanced through Ryoko’s chest as she seized Washu’s arm.

I’m hurt…

The image of Tenchi and the rest of her adopted family being
obliterated in a colossal, lethal, searing maelstrom of dark azure
flashed in her mind.

To hell the pain!

Her will drew her mind beyond the earthly constraints of her
weakened body.

Ryoko and Washu materialised about twenty metres from Seida, and
the space pirate collapsed out of weakness as Washu, forcing her
sore body to move forward, ran ahead with the Stasis Discharger
aiming for the spymaster. 

The golden energies increased in brilliance and intensity as they
detected the Tachyon flow in close proximity, growing from seething
to raging in a few milliseconds by tapping the nearby focus of power,
then sending a swift shimmering shaft of scintillating radiance racing
towards the white robed man.

Seida’s silvery eyes lit up for a moment in a mask of utter frustration
and fear. "N..!" His cry of frustration was cut off as the light
descended upon him and the blaster of gathering darkness in his
hand, surrounding him in a stream of brightness…

"You lose…" Washu managed, her words almost a sigh of relief, then
fell forward onto the ground.

A moment of silence, as all pairs of eyes fell on the two distant figures
sprawled on the ground, plus the block on the dais . Even Koneko 
and Anako seemed to have realised what had transpired entailed life 
or death for them, and remained transfixed where they were.

Then, there was a brief patter of running feet, as Tenchi covered the
ten odd metres between himself and Ryoko.

"We’re alive!" Sasami screamed in elation, and cannonballed into
Aeka, hugging her tightly around the waist, and her sister, tearing her
eyes from the upsetting scene ahead, bent down and gently stroked
Sasami’s hair.

Joy finally dawned on Mihoshi’s shocked expression. "Oh, this is…"
Her voice died as she realised that unlike Sasami, she had no one to
turn to share her feelings with any more.

Kiyone and Kova were locked in a tight embrace, their bodies
pressing close together. Kova’s eyes watched as his right hand
slowly ran through Kiyone’s hair, while she held on tightly to his
neck, with her head resting gently on his right shoulders and chest,
her eyes closed in happiness.

"You’re alive, Kova-chan." The hand around his neck caressed his
back and neck.

"So are you. And that’s all I could ever want."

Mihoshi watched, conflicting emotions coursing through her mind as
they slowly lifted their heads up and back off each other’s shoulders.
Their eyes locked for an instant, shining with ecstasy, then like
drowning men gulping fresh air, their lips met.

I am so happy for you, Kiyone.

A fragile smile formed on Mihoshi’s face, her blue eyes glittering with
teardrops, as Kova’s hands swept Kiyone off her feet and he drew
her close him like a groom with his bride. 

Then their lips parted.

"Kova-chan…" Kiyone’s eyes shone bright with passion, then she
realised where she was. "What the…?"

Kova grinned and whirled around in a rapid waltz, twirling her and
himself as her dark green hair streamed out behind in verdant
circles, seeming not to feel his hurts.

"Put me down!" She cried, her voice somewhere between
exasperation and exhilaration.

"Woohoo!" He laughed as he tossed her up above his head level,
and caught her with a swing of his arms again.

"Kova-chan!"

Laughing heartily, he hefted her, legs first, up and over his head,
before bringing her down. Just moments before her feet touched the
ground, he spun her around as he turned and caught her in his arms.

"Kova-chan!" Kiyone sounded much less vehement now, and
though she was conscious her feet were still off the ground, his
sapphire eyes and strands of dark blue hair hanging over them
seemed to be all her mind could take in now.

"Oh god, I love you so, Kiyone-chan." He held her close to him again,
and Kiyone sighed in blissful contentment.

The tears trickled down Mihoshi’s face.

Kiyone, I am so happy…

    ===========================================================

As Washu had froze Seida, a shuttle pulled out of the Comet’s
docking bay.

He looked back with some sort of relief. He had specially requested
this shuttle and its docking section be EMP-shielded and provided
with energy directly from the Comet’s generators so it could pull out
of the ship even with the Stasis Field in place.

As they entered space, the lights of the shuttle flickered and went
out.

What the…?

Oh yes, the EMP field works directly on the ship now…

"Solar, perform energy feed into the shuttle."

"Yes, sir."

He wondered if the Comet would explode soon. If Washu had been
too slow, it would of course rid him of his troubles, but given her
resourcefulness, it might have gone awry.

He shrugged. The entire ship was expendable, including the cyborg,
that was why he was on this shuttle.

As Solar linked up to the main ship energy feed, the lights turned
dimly back on, flickering occasionally, as the shuttle drew away from
the Comet.

"Overrule self-preservation status," he added to Solar.

    ===========================================================

"Washu?" Tenchi asked, supporting Ryoko as they stood over the
redhead. "Are you okay?"

Washu opened her eyes, and looked at them. "What do you think,
huh? ‘Course I’m fine!" She tried to get up. "Oh..." Her muscles hurt,
and she massaged them gently. "Well, I’m alive, if that’s what you
mean."

"What about him?" Tenchi gestured at the golden transparent block
on the dais.

Washu took some deep breaths, getting unsteadily to her feet. Ryoko
steadied her with a hand. "We’ll take him into custody, on board
Ryo-oh-ki." She spoke slowly, and carefully. "Kova can order the
Comet crew to return back to Synera, using his voice."

"So we…?"

"…call it a day."

    ===========================================================

Finally, the light in the shuttle stopped flickering as they left the EMP
field behind.

He looked at Solar, a mere chair of metal beside him.

"Solar, Solar, do you read me?"

There was no response. He ordered the ship’s computer to run a
scan on Solar.

‘Unit disabled permanently, due to loss of operating power. Chances
of recovery - one out of ten googols.’

He nodded to himself, running his fingers over the sleek, smooth
surface of the chair. Pure Solvarium, he could probably return the
material to the Labs to be worked on again, maybe as a different
model now.

‘Path set for Synerean airspace, seventy by forty by sixty points from
planet Colrathius.’

If only he had that Tachyon Blaster, he could finish it all here and
now, but he had to give it up or jeopardise his own survival. Of
course, there are other ways to work about it…

A transmission screen flickered on.

"Galaxy Police Headquarters, how may we help you?"

"Put me to Section Chief Code 37A, of Standard Enforcement Units."

"Identifying Source - Synerean Cruiser Shuttle, rank Captain.
Request approved."

There was a pause, then the image of the Section Chief appeared.

"Oh, it’s you again, Captain." The man looked flustered and worried.
"What happened? Why aren’t you on the Comet? And do you know
what happened to 2nd class Chief Inspectors Kiyone and Mihoshi, or
their ship the Yagami? "

"I am very sorry to inform you the Yagami has been destroyed."
Overlord watched in veiled amusement as the Section Chief inhaled
sharply. "I believe a certain Kova Kashiro I warned you earlier about
to be responsible, for both the Yagami’s destruction and for the
hijacking of my cruiser, the Comet."

The Section Chief’s expression sunk despondently. "Oh…"

"Will you be sending any men over to investigate? I have reason to
believe the villain is still within this Solar System."

"We have…" the Section Chief began, and stopped. To say they
have sent someone would be, in a way, untrue. "Two of our officers
are proceeding to the Solar System now, Captain." He did not think it
prudent to inform the outsider of the precise circumstances under
which these two had left the HQ. "About your ship?"

"Oh, if it is not destroyed, I expect the Comet to show up in Synerean
airspace. I have, after all, four hundred marines on it, and they will
eventually overpower the subverters or drive them out. The crew
have sealed orders on exactly which planet to head to in such an
eventuality."

The officer nodded, concurring. "Your evacuation?"

"An act of prudence, especially given the sensitive information to
which I am privy, High Command has it that I am to take all measures
necessary to prevent myself from falling into enemy hands." He took
a deep breath. "Death even, if necessary."

The Section Chief bowed in empathy and respect. "Anything else,
Captain?"

"Yes." His silver eyes brightened. "I do not believe two officers are
enough. May I suggest the employment of certain bounty hunters?"

"No, certainly NOT!" The Section Chief frowned. "Our policies have
stated it clearly - no dealings with bounty hunters. We are the sword
of justice, not exterminators that indiscriminately eradicate anything
deemed as a affliction, but those who attempt to prove it is such
first."

Overlord let himself get away with an open smile. "I understand. But
the safety of officers is also an important priority, is it not?"

The Section Chief licked his lips and remained silent.

"Tell you what. I have the authority to set up a bounty for Kova
Kashiro, worth over 15 million Synereals, or 10 million Juraian
dollars." 

The Section Chief’s eyes bulged out in shock at the sheer amount of
money involved.

"I merely request the Galaxy Police’s services as an arbiter into those
quarters, especially that this reward is brought to the notice of the
infamous bounty hunter Nagi."

"Well, erm…"

"Surely Nagi’s assistance will better your officers’ chances of
survival."

"But not our…"

"Oh, did I mention if a bounty hunter successfully returns his head to
us, any arbiters will receive a ten percent commission too?"

The Section Chief thought a while. "All right, Captain, we’ll do it."

"Thank you, Chief. That will be all."

    ===========================================================

By late evening, when they returned to Earth, almost all the
members’ of the Masaki household who were feeling better than they
had been, thanks to Washu’s ministrations, which were significantly 
better than Kova’s.

"Man, it’s good to be back," Tenchi smiled, with the two girls beside
him, as the surroundings around him changed from the interior of
Ryo-oh-ki to the verdant field before his house. Some dark craters
were burnt into the grass, testimonies to the battle that had raged
here just that morning. 

"Seeing home makes me feel better already," Ryoko put her hand
around Tenchi. Her wound still hurt, but much less now.

She stiffened as she felt Aeka’s hand reaching out around Tenchi
too, as did the princess.

"What do you mean your home?" Aeka asked, sounding a little tart.
"It’s Lord Tenchi’s."

"What’s yours is ours, ne, Tenchi?" Ryoko whispered into his ear.

Tenchi gulped, sweat beading on his head.

"Ryoko!" Aeka’s voice bit a little sharply into Tenchi’s ear. "Please
remember we are only Lord Tenchi’s guests."

Tenchi could not help but look up at the darkening sky over his
house, his expression helpless.

So much for that. Wishful thinking, I guess…

Behind them Kiyone stood with Mihoshi and Kova flanking her on
either side.

"We’re finally back!" Mihoshi laughed, as Koneko and Anako
wrestled on the grass beside her and rolled into a crater, getting
themselves splattered with the soil.

"So, this is the Masaki household from the outside." Kova looked
ahead, his face intent. "Seems more serene then when I first visited
this place."

"Most of us like it here." Kiyone watched him, as the evening breeze
caused his night blue hair to ripple like water and the longer strands
to wave across his forehead and cheeks. "We all have pleasant
memories of this place."

"Well, I should be joining you tonight here, then. I am usually more
myself by myself."

"But now we have each other."

"Yes, and everything has changed." Rather than pull her close, he
turned his gaze onto her, seeming probing into her mind, although
his eyes seemed distant and introspective.

He could not last remember when freedom and adventure mattered
the most to him.

She could not last remember when promotions and arrests mattered
the most to her.

"It has. As we have." Kiyone answered.

Washu watched the two groups before them, sighing as she dragged
herself along behind them. Sasami, her only companion by her side
apart from Ryo-oh-ki, who had formed into a somewhat battered and
weary cabbit on Sasami’s head, seemed to be able to read her mind.

"Mihoshi seems a little lonely." She watched as Aeka and Ryoko fell
silent, as the three of them walked over to Tenchi’s house. "And I
think Ryoko and Aeka don’t mind each other so much.

"Some things change, Sasami." Washu’s eyes were fixed on Kova
thoughtfully. "Even myself, I guess."

Sasami looked a little lost, but ultimately she knew what counted.
"Will it be for the better?"

"I hope so."

A rumbling sound was heard, and Kiyone and Kova simultaneously
turned to the blonde.

"Oooh…" Mihoshi broke into a nervous grin. "Sounds like dinner
time, huh?"

"Sasami, you think you fit enough to cook?" Washu queried.

"Think so." Sasami replied. "Though I’ll probably either be a little
slow or have to cook less. "What about you, Washu?"

"Oh, I think I’ll be putting down science for a while, at least for the
next four hours. I need a break."

"I think we all do." Including me, she added mentally.

    ===========================================================

Tenchi picked the note off the sofa as they entered.

‘Welcome back, Tenchi.

Your father and I are at the shrine, and we’ve eaten already. He’s still
a little shocked at everything, although not so after some chess
games together, so it would be best if you could explain it all to him
when you fetch him back tonight after dinner.

Grandpa.’

Tenchi frowned at the note. "Washu, why does Grandpa always
seem to know what will happen?" Sometimes it felt almost as if all
their struggles out there were little more than unnecessary,
unimportant little inconveniences in life, at least from Katsuhito’s
point of view.

Washu shook her head at the boy’s naiveté. "He’s over seven
hundred years old, Tenchi. Give him some credit on assessing
probabilities and likelihoods."

"Hang on, everyone," Sasami hurried off into the kitchen. "Dinner
should be ready soon."

"How soon?" asked Kiyone, looking pointedly at Kova, who
surreptitiously averted his face.

"I don’t know, it’s pretty late now already." Sasami’s voice was
heard. "I’ll try, though."

Kova pursed his lips to whistle, but no sound came out, partially
because of the look Kiyone was giving him.

Mihoshi gave a tired little sigh. "But I’m so hungry…"

"So am I," Tenchi added. "We’ll just have to wait it out."

Kova shifted a little uneasily in his chair behind the sofa, but could
not help noticing Kiyone lip speak something like, ‘Are you going, or
will I have to help you?’ with a stern expression on her face.

"Erm, excuse me…" Kova stood up, and headed for the kitchen.

"Huh?" Aeka, seated beside Tenchi turned behind as the man
disappeared into the kitchen, before her eyes fixed on Kiyone,
whose face was looking faintly amused and irritated, while her mouth
was curled in a tight pout, a little reminiscent of those moments with
Mihoshi before she actually started screaming. 

The green haired detective sighed. "Men…"

===========================================================

"Hi, Sasami." Kova watched as Ryo-oh-ki, sitting in a corner,
reduced a carrot down to nothing.

"Hello…" The little princess didn’t even turn to face him, just bustled
about as best she could. Though she felt better already, there
seemed to be this constant soreness in and around her body that
slowed her movement. "Oh, this is so tiring…" Sasami had enjoyed
cooking almost as long as she could remember, and this was about
the first time the enjoyment did not outweigh the effort.

"Could I, well, be of assistance?"

"Sure, Kova," Sasami opened the fridge and started taking things
out. "What *can* you cook?" Memories of Aeka and Ryoko helping
out still gave her the shivers at times.

"Anything you might have some excessive trouble or tedium getting
ready."

Sasami thought about it a little. "I’ll take your word for that." The
water in the pot plopped as various ingredients broke through its
surface. "Meat, then."

"Thank you." Kova smiled as he got to work. He had to admit
though, it was the first time he had done cooking wearing his
battlesuit. 

===========================================================

"Dinner’s ready!" Sasami called to the six people watching
television, as Kova strolled out of the kitchen balancing three dishes
in his right upturned hand, like a waiter.

"Oh right, at last!" Ryoko exclaimed, even as Mihoshi ran over. Kova
ignored her as he rather coolly lowered all three dishes to near the
table surface, and used his left hand to sweep them off carefully into
position.

Kiyone’s amused expression faded as she watched him work.
"Kova-chan, are you feeling better?" He had all the demeanour of a
waiter, but the way he laid the dishes, still wary of his left shoulder…

"Definitely." His eye appraised the dishes. "Especially with all this
food."

Kiyone rolled her eyes. "Come on, it still hurts, doesn’t it?"

"Negligibly so." Kova looked around at the assemblage at the table.
Even Washu seemed almost eager to fill her cravings for food, while
Mihoshi was positively slavering. Only Kiyone seemed to walking
over with no definitive hunger pangs. Kova gestured to a place
between him and Mihoshi before he and Kiyone sat down together.

"Hey, where’s the main course?" Ryoko muttered.

"Coming!" Sasami hurried out, holding the meat and the bowls of
rice in a tray.

"What took you so long, Sasami?" Aeka asked.

"Oh, I had to do some things." She gave Kova a wink.

The spy nodded modestly. "It’s an honour to be appraised by the
greatest."

Aeka brows twitched questioningly, before Sasami placed
everything on, and the table exploded into a wild free for all as
chopsticks backed by ravenous stomachs reached out in a mad
rush.

"You’re not eating?" Kiyone asked Kova, who was watching, mildly
amused.

"I’ll wait and see." His chopsticks carefully picked out another grain
of rice and he placed it in his mouth, chewing carefully on it. Kiyone
stared at him, wide-eyed.

Just when I think I’ve seen it all, there’s a guy chewing *a* grain of
rice…

My guy…

"This has got to be the best meal…" Ryoko tried to speak between
mouthfuls. 

"I must admit the vegetables are inordinately tasty." Aeka managed a
sentence before her chopsticks deposited something into her mouth
again.

"The meat’s rather special too," Tenchi added. "Say, how come you
cook so well this time?"

Sasami giggled. "I’ve always cooked it this way."

"Hunger makes the best cook." Washu watched as Mihoshi
continued stuffing herself, then her gaze slid down to Kiyone taking
moderate helping, and lastly to Kova, who seemed to be genuinely
interested in chewing grains of rice. "But the meat does taste truly
different from your usual style."

"Oh, Kova did that." Sasami pointed out

There was a sudden silence as most of the assemblage stopped
eating for a moment, except for Mihoshi and Kiyone.

"What?" Washu said.

"Come on," Kiyone helped herself to another morsel. "You all saw
him go into the kitchen, didn’t you? Go on, try it…" The last one was
addressed particularly to the man next to her, who was looking at the
piece of meat she had placed on his practically still full bowl.

Kova stared at it as if he were looking at poison, then downed it at a
shot. "Hmmm, this is…" His eyebrows arched in pleasant surprise.
"…very good…" His eyes swivelled over to Sasami.

"Yes?" The little princess asked, innocently, as everyone resumed
eating.

"Could you tell me what you added to this?"

"Maybe next time." Her gaze was cast over the dishes before them.
"Why don’t you eat first?"

Kova frowned a little, before he caught Kiyone’s expression.

"For heaven sakes, Kova-chan, do you want me to have to feed
you!?"

"Well, I’m not used to eating with so many people around me…"

Kiyone smiled a little too kindly and patted him on the back. "Well,
you’re a spy, so I’m sure you will learn fast, right?" Her voice was
just a little too patronising.

"All right, don’t mind if I do." Kova conceded, and started his meal in
earnest.

===========================================================

Kova watched as the golden block and its contents flashed in and
out of existence in the machine, that looked like a big glass tank with
metal above and below. The door behind Kova opened slightly, and
Kiyone stepped in, having bathed and changed into her usual white
blouse and green tights, as well as having tucked Mihoshi in to
sleep.

"Okay, here goes…" Washu murmured, facing the keyboard.

Seida, the Tachyon Blaster and the Stasis Cell vanished, as numbers
flashed on the screen of the Washu’s terminal. Washu stepped over
by the machine, then as the numbers stopped rolling by, she
reached out into a hole at the machine’s base.

There was a slight clank, as the Tachyon Blaster landed in her hand,
and Seida materialised in the machine itself, still surrounded by
glass, his other blaster still in his right hand. He stared around
frantically through the glass, as though he were a caged animal.

Looking straight at Kova with hatred burning in his silvery eyes, he
raised the blaster and fired.

The red beam vanished as it struck the insides of the glass.

"Tsk, tsk, that won’t help you, Seida." Washu announced
triumphantly. Seida gave her a glare full of daggers. "It’s laser proof."

"Well, how do you feel now, Seida?" Kova laughed. 

Their white robed prisoner seemed not to hear them, as he continued
glaring at Washu.

"He can’t hear you, Kova, nor you him." Washu told him. "You’ll need
this…" She tossed him what looked like a earphones with a modified
speaker. "That’s funny, he’s not saying anything…"

Kova put on Washu’s device. "Hello, Seida, you read me?"

The prisoner turned his baleful gaze back onto him, but he remained
oddly silent.

"Seida?" Kova tried. "You there?"

The blaster came up, glowing red, then Seida jammed the weapon’s
muzzle straight into the glass and fired at the same time, aiming for
Kova. Washu, Kiyone and Kova took a step back as the glass
flashed bright red and cracked.

"What the hell?" Washu tried, then blinked in surprise as a possibility
struck her.

Seida jammed the blaster into the glass again, his finger about to pull
back.

"Get down!" Kiyone cried, knocking Kova down as the glass
shattered and the red beam arced out through the darkness of
Washu’s laboratory.

Rolling down behind the machines in the lab, the three of them took
cover as the white-haired man shot wildly around the room.

"I don’t believe that!" Washu panted. "That glass can absorb up to
five times a regular blaster base, and no human I know can inflict that
kind of pressure on it!"

"He’s not Sakanoi!" Kova gritted his teeth, then he and Kiyone rose
up, the latter’s GP blaster firing as the former leaped out, scythe at
the ready.

The red blasts ricocheting off the gleaming cerulean scythe and the
golden shots from the GP blaster struck around Seida, and Kova’s
eyes turned grim as a red shot took the man in the waist and
Kiyone’s shots struck him in the shoulder and chest.

"Looks like my game’s up." The mechanical voice murmured, as the
holes sealed themselves.

Seida continued firing without pause, as his left hand came up and
released more bursts of red beams.

"It’s a cyborg!" The scythe descended down as the red sword came
up to parry the sweep. The beams from the right hand blaster
coruscated off the shield on Kova’s forearm. Washu quickly
re-summoned her terminal next to her.

Kiyone frowned in irritation, her hands now holding up Kova’s
explosive blaster. The cyborg was in sights now, but Kova was in the
way. "Kova-chan, clear out!"

The blade blocked the scythe, and Kova tried the bypass method,
but this time the cyborg leaped diagonally to the side, as his leg
swept out in an arc that struck hard on Kova’s injured right calf. He
cried out in pain, rolling away, as his scythe’s path changed from a
diagonal sweep into a downwards side swipe, shearing the robot’s
shooting arm off as he withdrew from before it.

Satellite had just enough time to glimpse Kiyone’s grimly set mouth
and steely eyes before the yellow beam ripped into his lower left
torso and his vision was engulfed in a golden blaze.

Washu came out from behind, spraying the chemicals about as bits
of Teranium littered the insides of her lab.

"Damn." She examined the smoking pieces of machinery, struck by
the various beams and caught in the explosion’s radius. "That
cramps my style in here for a while, I guess."

Kova was sitting down to one side, his hands massaging his calf
carefully.

"You’re all right, I suppose?" Kiyone watched him anxiously despite
the slight sarcasm in her voice.

Something in him reared up in irritation, and his brows knitted,
before he realised he deserved that, in a way. "Yeah, good as new,"
he grinned back mischievously. "Come help me up."

"I wonder how you manage if people take your words at face value."
Kiyone shook her head and complied. "What did you tell the GP the
time they rescued you after you took down those pirates?"

"Good day?" 

There was a smack as Kiyone slapped him on the forehead. "Oh,
come on!"

"Actually nothing much. Kinda along the lines of ‘Oh, it’s you people.
Thanks for saving me now and hope you enjoy killing me later.’" He
subsided into a frown, as his calf shrieked out a series of distressed
nerve signals, and his thoughts returned to Seida. "I wonder where
Seida really is?"

"Wherever he is, definitely not here." Washu replied flatly. "Probably
on his way to wherever he’s going."

"Maybe we should have checked the Comet first." Kiyone said. "At
least those of us that were feeling better, rather than just let them
off."

"No, I don’t think my old sensei works this way. He probably got out
way before anything actually happened." His hand clenched into a
fist as he thought how the man had been prepared to sacrifice his
own crew as well as three hundred and fifty good marines just to
facilitate an escape.

"I’ll say he’s good all right." Washu answered. "He probably had the
brains to dictate to this cyborg exactly what to say, in the most
appropriate tone and inflection, or you would have recognised it was
not him." She looked speculatively at the Tachyon Blaster in her
hand. "Do you think he gave this back to us just so he could escape,
or he has made some kind of arrangements so he could actually
afford to return this?"

Kova’s brows knitted together. "Personally, I think he has got what
he wanted. Not only is it not his style to give up something after
getting it, I think he would be facing certain death back in the
Syndicate if he loses a ship and a splendid weapon while not
obtaining any substantial yield."

Washu carefully turned the blaster over and over in her hand. "How
long do you think he would take to build another one of this?"

"Quite a while. I had to wrack my brains really hard just to figure out
how to shrink it enough to fit it into the Shuriken, and I had a
forty-year course back at the Science Academy."

"Then I think I shall stay for a while more, before I go hunting for
him." She thought about the Shuriken. "Kashiro, about…

Kiyone saw she was going to press Kova for *his* weapons. "…my
Yagami," Washu turned and looked at her somewhat acidly, but
Kiyone ignored her displeasure. "I was wondering if you could get it
done, at least the bridge, I may need to contact my HQ soon."

Washu’s gaze travelled from Kiyone to Kova, who shrugged, a wry
smile on his face.

"Oh, all right. I’ll try to get the bridge section. From what I saw from
my detector, the larger fragments are nearer the hull of the ship, so
your ship must have been struck from behind. The bridge should be
mostly intact, I’ll just try to rig up some power source for it. But, if you
want the whole ship back, you’ll have to let me settle matters with
Kashiro first, Kiyone."

"Thank you, Washu." Kiyone bowed.

"Glad to see you trust me, professor."

"You won’t run." She told him, confidently. "Not with Kiyone sticking
her little finger into you like that."

Kiyone and Kova both smiled nervously, especially at some images
the metaphor evoked.

"Honestly though, some time you’ll have to tell me how the two of
you hit off. Even Tenchi and Ryoko had a definitive article," she
recalled the Adventures in Time and Space. "And that was a long
while after they met. But for you two, all I recall is seeing Kiyone
suddenly become a little more obtrusive," Kiyone rolled her eyes at
the comment on her interjecting on Ryoko and Aeka’s behalf. "And
flustered. Besides, I’d like to know why you two didn’t kill each other
the day you met."

"You’re pretty nosy for an academic, professor."

"I live to learn." Washu answered. "Besides, there are some things
not even scientific knowledge of pheromones, hormones and other
biochemical reactions can explain."

For a reply, Kiyone winked at Kova, who winked back.

Washu cogitated for a while, wondering if she should test out their
footing and confidence. 

Well, here goes…

"Maybe you can invite me to join your kids when you tell them about
the two of you." And immediately regretted what she said.

Both Kova and Kiyone closed their eyes, their faces ashen.

"Our future is still a little… uncertain, Washu." Kiyone whispered,
trying to hide the tremor in her voice. 

"Keep your questions to yourself, professor." Kova answered,
tersely.

The two turned as one, as their hands clasped together, and left the
lab.

===========================================================

It was already quite late. Nobuyuki was sleeping on the couch again,
after having understood his troubles were gone for good, while the
rest of the company were sleeping in their respective quarters,
having decided to have an early rest after dinner for the rigours of
the day. Kiyone supported the slightly limping Kova as they emerged
from the lab.

"Let’s go see this Karaoke room of yours, Kiyone." He murmured
softly. 

Kiyone nodded, and the two proceeded on their way silently. Before
long they stepped into the velvety darkness of the room.

"This…is nice, Kiyone." He looked up at the glowing stars, feeling
the heater cum air conditioner at work, and his fingers turned the dial
for the light, so it was just barely glowing, before sitting down on the
one seater sofa. Kiyone checked his calf injury, only to find it was
bleeding badly again.

"Medikit." She ordered.

Kova produced it from his portal and passed it to her, as she
carefully cut open the dressing, staunched the bleeding, and
dressed it up in fresh bandages again.

"Thank you, Kiyone-chan." He smiled as she got up. "I really owe
you."

"It’s nothing, really. Though I wonder why is it you always get struck
there?"

He shrugged. "Pure bad luck, I guess. How’s your back?"

"It ought to be better now." She plonked herself on the main sofa,
perpendicular to Kova’s seat and facing the television set. The faint
glow of the lights gave the room a soft, comfortable feel, accentuated
by the dark coloured furniture that made it seem they were all alone
in the velvet night, with the soft glow of the stars keeping vigil over
them.

Kova closed his eyes with a faint smile, breathed in deeply and
leaned back with his hands behind his head, feeling his weary body
sink into the softness of the single seat sofa. She watched him,
sitting in the chair like a man in his own house after a hard day of
work.

With his own family…

"Kova-chan?"

"Hmmm?"

"Do you…" Kiyone’s voice trembled, and she stopped, trying to
prevent her voice from catching in her throat. "…really want…" Her
eyes shut tight, trying to blot out the images she could feel starting to
rise from the depths of her minds again. 

Her dreams.

By themselves they were wonderful, but their beauty made
nightmares ever so unbearably painful, marred reality for the high
propensity for darkness it held.

She felt someone move and settle down beside her, and a hand
rested on her shoulder.

"Of course I do," his tender, sincere voice whispered by her ear, and
she felt his lips brush her cheeks. "To share my future, my life, with
you, is all I could ever ask for."

"I know," Kiyone pressed her lips tight together, regaining her
composure and raised her head to face him, only to see the sadness
radiating in his eyes. "You’re worried about it too, aren’t you?"

Kova nodded. "Back there… I thought I had lost you."

The boundless universe of dazzling rose light returned to him, like
an endless road to an eternity of loneliness.

"I thought I was going to die." He felt himself grow cold at the
memory. "All alone in the light, lost forever. It hurt…"

Kiyone put an arm around him, pulling him over before her. "You
must have been very scared."

"I was." A pause. "And I still am." 

She could feel his arms tighten around her, as he seemed to draw
comfort from her warmth, her proximity, from the fact that she was
with him.

I never thought it would be like this.

When I first met him, I could never have anticipated him so weak, so
in need of me. Nor did I expect myself to be so affected by him either.
He reluctantly admits to being physically injured, yet he is so open
about his inner fears for me, for us. 

Which only goes to show how much I mean to him.

Love is so debilitating! The old Kiyone shrieked at her. Drop it, you
don’t need it!

But I do… She smiled sadly.

"Kiyone-chan, will it always hurt so much?" He asked. "Will every
time be so painful?" He thought back to the heart-wrenching agony,
both in space and in the elevator shaft of the Comet.

"I think it will."

"So that’s why great lovers aren’t particularly great adventurers." He
murmured, his head resting lightly on her shoulder. 

Kiyone’s hands stopped stroking his soft hair for a moment.
"Kova-chan, are we…?"

"Oh yes, I do believe we are in love," his expression was at once
morose and yet radiant. "Very much so, in fact."

"No, I meant, are we, the word after the first great…?"

Kova raised his head off her shoulder and looked up in surprise as
he felt her flesh flush warm to his touch. Kiyone blushed deeply, her
eyes bashful yet somehow maintaining contact with his. The dim
light that just illuminated their faces blended perfectly into the velvet
darkness near the base of the room, while the stars above seemed to
glow warmly like their hearts.

"You know," Kova started uncertainly. "I am no great…" he left the
word unspoken. "…, and from the time I met you, I didn’t think you or
I would want this for ourselves."

"So did I. I thought it would only be when our future was assured."
Kiyone answered, her voice soft. "I thought we would want to save it
all up. But in that moment you thought you would lose me, you
regretted, didn’t you?"

"So you know."

"I felt it too. When your face fell from me, and left me looking on the
insides of that shuttle. When I was in the escape capsule with
Mihoshi. When I could feel your blood seeping into my uniform… It
felt that way too."

In the soft light of the room, everything seemed to fade into the
background, until they could only see one another.

He could feel himself flush warm too now, but not with
embarrassment. "God, Kiyone, how could I ever have turned from
you?"

"Because you loved me." She replied. "So much you were afraid I
would get hurt if something happened to you."

"It hurts me so much now, sometimes I wonder how much worse it
could get." He felt himself losing control, gradually. "Is it the same for
you?"

"Yes." She smiled. "How much worse could a little thing like this
make it?"

He looked at her uncertainly, trying to rally the remnants of his will
against the rising flag of desire. There were some things he had read,
some things he felt made sense. "Have you ever…?"

Kiyone watched him, his words hanging in the air between them.
Something in her told her to try something out, and her face coiled
up in concentration as her eyes looked to the ceiling.

Kova felt sweat bead on his brows, as the seconds ticked by, and
Kiyone counted one, two, three on her fingers, pausing between
every finger raised. Finally, she stopped at four.

"Four?" He managed weakly, his mind foundering. "Times or men?"
He dimly remembered something she told him before, could she
have been ly…

Well, that makes it less likely it will affect her much, right? His more
animal side reminded.

"No." She smiled playfully. "None. I didn’t lie to you about men in my
life." He sagged in relief. "The one thing where I’m behind Mihoshi.
You’re new to this too, aren’t you?" She could tell by the
semi-outraged look his face had adopted.

"Yes. Apart from medical studies and…" He decided not to tell her
his recent interest on nerve endings and simulation in certain parts
of the human anatomy, specifically since after his lunch with her.
"Yeah, that’s about it."

"I see." Kiyone suddenly reached forward and they kissed
passionately, before their lips drew apart again. "Could tell, you tend
to let your mind get too much in the way."

For most part, his mind was a blank, but something inside dimly
registered her words before he advanced on her. Kiyone leaned
back, her lips teasing him, moving just slightly out of reach of his,
while her hands stroked the front of his battlesuit as she lay back.

‘None’… his mind’s thought to that earlier comment fought
desperately against the mighty walls of desire, passion and instincts,
but over a century of training and mental discipline finally managed
to secure a tiny breach through the walls to him.

Kova’s mouth suddenly pulled back from over hers.

"Kova-chan?" She looked up at him. 

"A lady’s first time means a lot to her." 

"This certainly does, especially at this moment." Her eyes twinkled,
unlike her usual self.

Come on, what are you waiting for!? He felt something scream at
him.

"What’s wrong?" Kiyone asked, fear showing in her eyes.

She had never, ever offered herself before so willingly, and her heart
constricted at the thought of rejection.

"I need you to promise me something." He licked his lips, trying to
stave off the primal hunger.

"I’m all yours." She replied solemnly, and he knew she meant it in
more ways than one.

"Please…" 

Please agree, so we can get on with it! Cried the other Kova.

"…promise me if anything happens to me…" He pursed his lips.
"You will live."

There was sudden silence.

"You will live fully." A pause. "Without me, if need be."

Kiyone looked into his earnest blue eyes, the dim light shining from
behind him, making him seem dark and cold, like a dying star… "I…"

"Promise me, swear it to me!" He begged, imploring.

"I love you…" She managed, tears forming in her eyes. "I’m sorry,
but you ask too much…" Her lower lip quivered. "Whether you are
dead or alive, lost or by my side, I will never stop loving you…"

"Damned you, say it! Just say it!" He cried, almost like he had on
board the Yagami, while his mind raged at himself for forcing that
question out. "Swear it so we can get on with this!" Kiyone looked at
him, hurt, and he suddenly subsided. "Please Kiyone." He lapsed
from his usual form of address. "I don’t ask you to stop loving me."

Kiyone nodded. "You ask me to love me more than I love you." She
smiled bitterly. "Because you love me more than yourself." Tears
glimmered from her eyes. "I’m sorry, Kova-chan."

"All I ask is that you love yourself more than me… is that so hard?"
The sapphire eyes beseeched her, not just his mind, but also his
passion.

"You love me more than yourself. Surely it is no different for me."
She shook her head slightly, parrying. "I love you more than myself
too." She fenced. "If I asked you to swear the opposite, could you?"
And thrust. "Would you?" The emeralds pierced sapphire, and cut
deep.

"Then I’m sorry too," Kova drew back, almost in agony. "But I have
to be sure, Kiyone-chan." He slowly let himself sit back, forcing his
raging hormones down, then suddenly stood up and made for the
door. Kiyone sat up from her prone position, eyes blazing.

"KOVA!" Her tone was wrathful, yet somehow entreating. "Where do
you think you’re going!?"

He paused for a good moment. "Don’t worry," he replied, when he
was sure of his answer and of his voice not faltering. "You don’t
mean anything less to me." He made to move out again.

"Please, Kova …" She tried to hold back the ache inside her. "Don’t
leave me…" 

The flashback struck him so vividly he almost reeled. 

She was asleep again in the wan light of her apartment, crying out for
him, crying for him.

Let it be warm and comforting, let not the tears flow. Let it be a
dream, a dream of light. Pray that the nightmares of the dark recede,
that she be blessed with dream of bliss tonight.

She watched, trying to hold back the tears, as his muscles twitched
slightly in indecision, before he spun around rapidly, his movement a
blur, and Kiyone had a sudden impression of a predator leaping on
her. Somehow he managed to stop right beside her, his arms
seemingly on the verge of encircling her and pinning her down, but
not quite touching. She could feel his ragged breath, before her face,
and his features were contorted once again in the agony of self
denial. "I love you, and no other." 

She closed her eyes as his eager lips sought her again, but this time
it was only to lightly brush hers. Her brow knitted in astonishment,
and the emotional tension bottled within her came out as a sigh of
weary uncertainty.

"You tired?"

She shook her head. "Not physically." Her hand ran down his hair,
along the side of his face, stroking his neck gently, and she smiled
as she felt him tingle at her every touch. "Don’t reject me…"

"I’m never will. But you still have to promise me…"

Kiyone’s eyes hardened. "No."

"Pleasure has its price, so let’s sleep," he whispered soothingly. "I’m
sooo tired, Kiyone-chan." His voice dragged, growing softer. "Aren’t
you?"

She felt her eyelids droop with his at his slurring voice, then they
snapped open again. "Kova-chan, you can’t sleep now!"

"I’m sure." His eyes closed completely, and he half flopped, half
rolled off onto the ground, landing face up as the visual paragon of
peaceful slumber.

She swore at him in frustration, and wild thoughts ran through her
mind as she knelt beside him. His breathing was steady and even
now, but she knew he was awake, for his body still felt rather warmer
than usual

Maybe I ought to kick him there… she slew the thought as an utter
breach of trust.

Or maybe I could…NO! I will not demean myself!

Still clothed, she gently settled down in the narrow space
between Kova and the sofa’s base, and tried to snuggle in
comfortably, while also in the process rubbing against his body.

"If that’s what you’re trying to do, it won’t work." He murmured, his
lips moving slightly but otherwise perfectly still. "Worse things have
come my way." He thought back to the ladies in the Science
Academy, how he had disdainfully dismissed them, to their eternal
chagrin and humiliation, which ensured they never did trouble him
again. "For one thing, you’re still fully clothed."

Kiyone blushed, and cuddled in a little closer.

I don’t believe you’re made of stone, Kova-chan!

"If it helps for you to know, I rejected those before you because I
didn’t care and couldn’t be bothered with them." His arm curled
around Kiyone and drew her a little closer. "But I’m not rejecting you.
I just have to be sure, because I do care for you."

Kiyone sighed, finally deciding she had lost. "I understand." God, I’m
tired. "You’re scared too, aren’t you?"

"Mmmhmm." He yawned, trying to hide his discomfiture at the
thought. "Let’s sleep." Already he could feel her relaxing, and quickly
quashed the pang of disappointment that welled from within. "We’ll
save it for our wedding night." He shifted slightly away so there was
ample space for Kiyone to nestle in snugly between him and the
couch.

"Our dream…" She smiled as she closed her eyes, her hands placed
against him.

"To share. Good night, Kiyone-chan."

"At least a good night kiss?"

"With pleasure."

===========================================================

Yawning in weary irritation, Tenchi dragged himself out of his bed,
bleary eyed, and reached for the alarm clock on his desk. There was
another yawn of irritation, a slight growl, followed by a flash of
orange. Then silence.

He started into full awareness, as the charred gear of the clock spun
lazily around the top of his desk, barely twenty centimetres from his
fingers. Most of the rest of the contraption must have been
vaporised, he decided, as the pathetic disc of metal rolled off the
desk and landed with a dull clink on the floor.

"RYOKO!" He shouted.

"Hmmm…?" she rolled over slightly. "…want <yawn> sleep."

"What do you think you’re doing!"

"Try… get sleep." The cyan haired lady shifted a little more in her
futon on the floor.

"You could have killed me!"

"Huh…?" She turned over a little too quickly. "Ow! Damned, so much
for sleeping…" Her amber eyes opened sluggishly.

"How many times must I tell you *not* to blow things up around the
house!?"

"But, Tenchiii…! We were having so much fun together!"

Tenchi’s eyes widened. "Huh?"

Ryoko continued, her eyes distant and far-away. "We were lying
down in the garden on Jurai and you started…"

Tenchi backed off nervously. "Erm, never mind, Ryoko."

"But it was such a great dream!" She exclaimed, before giving him an
appreciative and speculative look. "Want to continue with it, Tenchi?
Here?" Ryoko felt her sleepiness seep away as she realised Tenchi
was all alone with her. "Come on, you certainly look like you enjoyed
it, at least back there, so why not here and now?"

"I think I’ll give it a pass."

"Don’t worry, I’m sure you’ll enjoy it." Ryoko gave him a toothy grin,
as she drew near, half stretching herself. "It’ll be… ow!"

"Are you all right?" Tenchi asked, stepping forward as Ryoko bent
slightly forward, her hand reaching carefully for the wound in her
side.

"I’m fine, Tenchi." Ryoko cursed her injury, annulling yet another
immeasurably precious moment all alone with Tenchi.

"You want to rest here, while I go get breakfast for you?"

She shook her head. "I’d like to eat with you, Tenchi. But thanks
anyway, especially for insisting I rest in your room last night so you
could watch over me." She remembered how Tenchi had explained
things to a distraught Aeka.

"It was nothing. I was so tired I fell asleep almost the minute I got in."
He smiled deprecatingly at his own empty gesture. "I didn’t do much
watching over last night."

Coming down the stairs, they found the living room empty, and
Sasami sleeping on the floor of the kitchen, curled up into a foetal
position.

"She looks so cute like that." Ryoko commented.

"Yeah, too bad…" Tenchi gently picked the little princess up,
preparing to carry her to the living room so she could rest on a
couch. "Give me a while, I’ll go fix breakfast."

Ryoko suddenly realised she ought to stop him, but it was too late…

"Oh, Tenchi…" Sasami’s eyes opened as he was about to leave the
kitchen, and took in the bright sunlight around. "What time is it?"

"I don’t know, Sasami, I didn’t get a chance to look at my clock, but it
should be about ten in the morning." He looked oddly at her. "What
were you doing in the kitchen?"

"Oh, I got up early to make breakfast for your dad, and for the rest of
you. It’s in the stove there…" She pointed, and Ryoko scowled at the
thought she and Tenchi might have got to eat breakfast all by
themselves if only she had been a little more alert. "I guess I must
have fell asleep waiting for you people to get up."

Tenchi gently placed her on the ground. "Where’s Ryo-oh-ki?"

"Probably asleep somewhere in my room." She looked at Ryoko and
Tenchi. "Say, are you both eating breakfast now?"

"Uh yeah."

"I’ll go get Aeka up."

===========================================================

"I’m coming for breakfast too, give me a moment!"

Sasami paused to let Ryo-oh-ki hop onto her head as her older sister
rushed past her and down the steps, before more voices echoed up
from downstairs.

"Good morning Tenchi, I trust Ryoko did not disturb your rest last
night?"

"I slept fine, Aeka." Tenchi was going to add that she had scared him
this morning though, but remembering how vehemently Aeka had
opposed the idea of Ryoko sleeping in Tenchi’s room, decided not to
bring it up.

"Miya."

Sasami, ever ready for this, took a carrot out of her pocket and
handed to Ryo-oh-ki.

I wonder if Kiyone and Mihoshi have gone to work. They certainly
would appreciate the breakfast I made for them.

The door, which Washu had reinstalled last night immediately after
dinner, materialised before her and she stepped through.

"Huh?"

Mihoshi was sound asleep in her futon, with two alarm clocks by her
head. One had stopped ringing, probably because it had ran out of
batteries, while the faint alarm from the other meant it would probably
go off soon too. Beside her, Kiyone’s futon had evidently not been
slept in at all.

"Mihoshi, Mihoshi?" Sasami switched off the dying alarm clock and
shook her. "Mihoshi!"

"Uhhhh…?" Mihoshi curled a little bit more, a smile curling up her
face.

This won’t be getting me anywhere, Sasami decided. How *does*
Kiyone wake her up every morning?

She returned to Tenchi’s house. "Tenchi, you know where Kiyone
is?"

"No." The voice came from below, as the other two feminine and
seemingly more and more disgruntled voices quietened. "Isn’t she
with Mihoshi in her place?"

Washu stepped out of her lab under Sasami who was peering down
from the stairs, and stretched herself exaggeratedly.

"Good morning, Washu!" The gang greeted.

"It had better be." She ran her fingers through her hair, as if tidying
them up a little. "Last night I fell asleep after clearing up the mess in
my lab." Then blinked, trying to open her sleepy eyes. "Not of course
that it was any trouble to clear it up, just that well, yesterday was
pretty full of exertions."

"I’m sure." Ryoko muttered sarcastically, then her ears caught up
with her mind. "What mess?"

"I’m sure you all remember Seida from the SSS Comet, don’t you?"
Washu answered. "Well, he wasn’t exactly human."

"That’s new. Let me guess – he is a madman?"

Aeka and Washu shot Ryoko a glance of irritation, while Tenchi’s
eyes flashed warningly, telling her not to cross Washu.

The scientist crossed her hands over her chest and continued. "No,
in fact he wasn’t. He was a cyborg."

"What?" Aeka asked, almost incredulously. "We went through all
*that* and we didn’t even get the person behind all our problems?"

"I’m sorry to say, yes. But we got my Tachyon Blaster back, while
Kashiro and Kiyone helped me wipe the floor of my lab with bits of
Teranium – that’s another one of our friends from early yesterday
morning we won’t be seeing again."

"Kiyone, in your lab?" Sasami pressed. "I thought she and Mihoshi
went back to their place to sleep, after dinner?"

"Last time I saw, she was heading out here with Kashiro." Washu’s
gaze swept cursorily over the room. "If you’re looking for her, she’s
probably somewhere around the house."

"Most likely where?"

"Let’s see." In less than a millisecond, Washu’s powerful brain
computed all the probabilities necessary. Shed, outside or carrot
fields practically nil, Masaki shrine unlikely due to Kova’s slight limp,
Sasami probably just been to her apartment, while Kova’s apartment
didn’t exist anymore, and they weren’t here…

===========================================================

She awoke to the air conditioned coolness amidst velvet darkness.
The lights had been switched off, with only the glowing stars above,
which had started to dim as they started expending their energy due
to the absence of other light. She could hear Kova breathing gently
beside her, one arm behind her and the other draped over her waist,
while there was a fragrant aroma somewhere in the room, nearby
that made her feel positively hungry.

Sitting up slightly, careful not to disturb the seemingly slumbering
Kova as her eyes adjusted to the darkness, Kiyone saw a dim metal
stand on the table, with what seemed like two dishes for breakfast,
and it seemed to radiate heat.

"Mmm… delicious…" She was about to reach for it when…

Dazzling light shone into the relatively dark room, blinding her for an
instant, and she raised her hand instinctively.

"Kiyone?" She heard a hi pitched voice ask. Sasami took in the
scene before her as Tenchi moved over, and her eyes saw the man
lying beside Kiyone, seemingly asleep. "Oooh…" Although of course
the darkness meant their clothing went almost unnoticed.

Tenchi quickly saw what caused Sasami to say that. "Erm, sorry to
disturb…" He smiled sheepishly, half bowing, before quickly pulling
the staring Sasami away. "Good night… I mean, morning…"

Still stunned, Kiyone watched as Tenchi’s silhouette pulled the
protesting little princess away, and the door shut again, causing the
darkness to return, albeit with little spots of light decorating the
shadows now. She felt warm now though, before she finally realised
her face was burning furiously…

===========================================================

"Was she in there?" Washu asked as she took her seat by the table.

"Yeah, she was." Tenchi replied, trying to appear nonchalant, leading
Sasami by the hand.

"Oh, yes!" Sasami nodded enthusiastically. "So was …"

"Hush…"Aeka catching the look in Tenchi’s eye and Sasami’s face,
quickly pulled Sasami over to her. "Now, you didn’t see anything, did
you, Sasami?" But despite that her face was well, rather amused,
and she seemed to be trying to prevent her smile from slipping into a
wide curve of glee.

"Bwahaha!" Ryoko of course, suffered no such restraint. "Hah,
could you ever imagine… Kiyone… Hahaha! …to a *pirate*!"

Something slammed open somewhere in the house. "I heard that!"
Kiyone’s face, stormy with emotion, appeared around the corner. 

"Oh, Kiyone…" Ryoko’s voice quivered as she fought to hide her
mirth. "Good morning." She grinned broadly. "How was last night?"
Her amber eyes gleamed in amusement.

"Look, we did *not*…" Kiyone shook a trembling index finger at
them. "Repeat, did *not* do *anything*."

"I’m sure…" Ryoko grinned, winking at Kiyone. "Aren’t you too,
Aeka?" 

"Well, I know that whatever it was, it is none of our business, Ryoko."
She lowered her head to her food slightly, but Kiyone could see her
smile. "Right, Sasami?" Her hand tightened around her sister’s
waist, who was making to go over, curiosity written all over her face.

"But I want to know what happened!" Sasami told Aeka. "What are
you all talking about?"

Washu chuckled at the detective’s discomfiture, and Tenchi couldn’t
help smiling despite himself and the certain amount of sympathy he
felt for Kiyone. The situation was reminiscent of what he felt when
Ryoko declared she had given birth to his baby what seemed a long
time ago, though it was merely a year before.

"No, Sasami." Aeka insisted.

Ryoko smiled broadly across the table at Sasami. "Well, they…"
Ryoko was inching closer to Tenchi, about to get up, and Aeka
stiffened.

Kiyone, face a deep scarlet, breathing hard with one hand on her GP
blaster, decided if the space pirate was going to go graphic, she
would open fire.

Quickly making up his mind, Tenchi clamped his hand around
Ryoko’s mouth, to Ryoko’s and Sasami’s consternation, as well as to
Aeka’s and Kiyone’s relief.

Washu waved at Kiyone. "Well, come out, you two!" She glanced
around the table. "Say, Sasami, where’s Kiyone’s and Mihoshi’s
share?"

"Mihoshi’s one is still in the stove. Kiyone’s and Kova’s seems to
have disappeared though." Sasami answered, as Aeka continued
eating and Tenchi gingerly let go of Ryoko’s mouth.

What the…? Kiyone remembered the food in the room…

THE BASTARD!

Sasami, seizing Aeka’s momentary lapse of attention, made a run for
it. 

"Sasami, get back here!"

"Kiyone?" She asked, shaking the staring detective out of her
stupor. "What happened last night?" The detective stared at her
blankly. "Something to do with Kova, right?"

In her current state of outrage, it was all Kiyone could do to stop
herself from slapping Sasami hard on the forehead. Instead, she
ignored Sasami’s questions, and stepped back to the open doorway.

"KOVA-CHAN!"

The figure on the floor seem to remain still, but then the smile Kiyone
thought she glimpsed could not having been purely imaginary, could
it?

"KOVA!" She shouted to the spy again.

"Wha…?" He moved a bit, rolling over so he faced the door. "Oh
good morning, Kiyone-chan…"

Kiyone’s eyes narrowed as she saw the crescent of white teeth like a
Cheshire in the darkness.

"Breakfast is ready." Kova adroitly leaped to his feet, and Kiyone
noted he seemed to be wearing something apart from his battlesuit.
"Thank you, Sasami."

"Urm, yah." The blue-haired princess replied. "How did you get it
here?"

"I brought it in. Why *were* you sleeping in the kitchen? You looked
so kawaii I couldn’t bear to wake you up!"

"Just fell asleep, I guess."

Kiyone reached out beside her and turned up the light, her face grim.
Kova was sitting behind the coffee table on the floor, with Sasami’s
breakfast in front of him, plus two cups of tea and a teapot, between
their plates on the metal device that resembled like some kind of
heater. He was no longer in his battlesuit, but wearing a zipped up
black jacket with silver shoulder lines, and a pair of black trousers.

"What time did you wake up, Kova-chan?" Kiyone’s hands clenched
and unclenched.

"About two, then I went to have a bath and change, before coming
back here. Then I got up at about seven to pick up breakfast for us."
He smiled faintly at her. "Why?"

"You were awake all the time, weren’t you!?"

"I guess," he gestured to the table. "Joining me for breakfast?"

Kiyone tilted her head slightly up, closed her eyes and put her hand
to her forehead.

I guess there will always be moments like this. How in the world does
he recover so fast?

"Kova-chan, you know *what* they’re thinking outside?"

"I should think so. Ryoko is loud enough." He picked up the teapot
and poured a cup each for himself and Kiyone. "Take a seat, please."

"What is it you’re talking about?" Sasami pressed, gently tugging at
Kiyone’s GP uniform. "What is it they are thinking?"

Kiyone ignored her. "Look, Kova-chan, they…"

"… can believe what they choose to believe." He looked up at her,
light glinting off his azure eyes. "I don’t give a damn."

That was the whole problem, wasn’t it? She heard her mind say. Like
Ryoko, he sometimes didn’t seem to care what other people think.

She walked over, leaving Sasami standing dissatisfied in the
doorway, and sat down before him. "Look, Kova-chan. I care."

"Why?" His eyebrows arched. "We love each other, don’t we?" He
sipped at his tea. "Besides, they would be right, except you didn’t
allow me to."

"Allow you…" She gnashed her teeth together. "*Allow* you!" She
stood up, her hands slamming into the coffee table as she shouted
out loud. "*You* were the one who refused *me*!!"

He glanced at her hands, then looked up at her, his face cold and
eyes piercing. "I thought you always wanted someone to love you
more than your body." His voice seemed calm, but there were
undercurrents of emotions running through it. "I have shown you
that."

Kiyone stared at him, as she felt his words strike deep, ring true. "I…
don’t want there to be anything between us…"

"You’re worried someday something might happen. And you want us
to share everything in case that should happen." He gave a cold
smile. "What I worry about is that someday something might happen,
and what I want is that if it happens to me, you must go on, by
yourself." 

Kiyone nodded. "Even if I may lose you, I wish to love you. Though it
will hurt me that much more if anything happens."

"And though every fibre of my being yearns for you so much it burns
like fire, I will *not* love you until you promise me *that*."

Kiyone ground her teeth together. "I think we should just eat."

Kova nodded, drained his cup of tea in a gulp, and poured another
one for himself as they brought their plates down before them.
"You’re late for work, you know. I could call them up…"

"To hell with that job, and no thank you."

Sasami stood frozen in the doorway, as they continued eating in
silence, before moving off.

===========================================================

Washu, Aeka, Ryoko and Tenchi stared as Kiyone briskly stepped up
the stairs, her clouded face the only hint of anything wrong. Then
she paused halfway, came back down, walked towards and past,
into the kitchen. Even Ryoko had the sense to keep quiet, before
Kiyone silently stalked out, holding Mihoshi’s breakfast, and
disappeared up the stairs.

A while later, Kova came out around the corner, carrying the plates.
He looked fresh as usual, but there was a slight lag in his steps and
his eyes, though awake and open, seemed a little lacklustre.

"Good morning," He smiled faintly, and continued on his way to the
kitchen.

Aeka turned to Sasami, who was the only one discreetly picking at
her food. "What happened, Sasami?"

"Huh?" She looked up, a little distractedly. "I don’t really know…"

Aeka’s eyes widened. "Sasami, did you see…!"

"Nothing really." She replied, her voice low. "They sort of…
quarrelled." Four sets of questioning eyes bore into her. "I didn’t
know what they were talking about." Then accusingly. "You wouldn’t
tell me."

There was a sound of washing in the kitchen, and Kova stepped out.
He regarded the table, a faint sardonic smile on his face, seemingly
half directed at himself, half at the others. "Good morning." He
repeated faintly, standing there for a moment before walking out of
the Masaki household into the field.

"Gee, wonder what’s biting him?" Ryoko mumbled, chopsticks half
in her mouth. "He got to go the girl, right?"

"Ryoko, Kiyone said nothing happened." Tenchi reminded,
sounding somewhat put off.

"Well, how do we know?"

Sasami hesitantly raised a hand. "They said they didn’t, whatever it
was… At least it sounded that way."

"Hmm, you sure?" Aeka finally gave in to curiosity. 

Washu shook her head at the congregation, thinking how juvenile
they were, but if Sasami didn’t catch anything wrongly, it could
provide interesting insights, so she kept her comments to herself
first.

"Well, Kova said something about not being allowed to, and Kiyone
was so mad she got up and shouted at him, then Kova said
something, and then they talked a little more about something
happening, before started eating quietly." She lowered her face.
"Real quietly."

Washu raised her eyebrows in surprise. Surely they weren’t worried
about the consequences of that? She had almost never seen
anybody so much in love, and those she had certainly didn’t seem
worried at all about that easily overcome problem, nor for that matter
anything else at all…

"Yeah right, you expect *me* to believe *nothing* went on all night
and he’s cross ‘cos he didn’t get to jack off, huh?" Ryoko added, her
demeanour sceptical and disinterested.

Tenchi sighed in exasperation. "Ryoko…"

Sasami glared angrily at the space pirate, then abruptly announced.
"I’m not cooking today." Before taking her plate and walking off into
the kitchen.

Washu frowned a little. "I’ll be in my lab if you want me."

Ryoko watched as the half the table emptied. "Hey, where’s
everyone going?" She whined. "What did I do? All I did was
comment…"

"It’s all your fault," Aeka chided. "You and your remarks."

"Are you trying to say I should have shut up!?" Ryoko growled.

"Why yes!" Aeka feigned astonishment, though her tone was a little
dangerously inviting. "My, aren’t we smart today?"

Well, Tenchi consoled himself. That is an improvement of sorts,
Ryoko’s hands haven’t started to crackle with energy yet.

"I’ll have you know, princess, that you’re crapping bullshit!"

"Me? Doing what!?" Aeka shrieked back. "I am a princess, I will not
have such cheek given to me of, by all *things*, the scum of space!" 

Tenchi wondered what they would do if he took out Tenchi-ken,
which was still in his pocket. "Please, Aeka, Ryoko!"

"But Tenchiii!" Ryoko howled. "She *insulted* me! *First!*"

"She was the one who started all this!" Aeka shrilled back. "If it
weren’t for *her*…"

Well, not a bad improvement, I didn’t have to shout that loud to get
their attention.

Tenchi took a deep breath. "Fine, then," and stood up. "I’m off. The
two of you can go kill each other if you like, but I’m swear the
murderer will get nothing from me." He turned away, then paused.
"Maybe one or two fatal swipes from Tenchi-ken." He smiled as
Ryoko and Aeka felt beads of sweat form on their heads. "Maybe."
He grinned to himself. Being around Kova did have some side
effects.

Aeka stared at Ryoko, then they both sagged as Tenchi left the
house.

"We will have to work something out." Aeka mumbled.

"Yeah." Ryoko added. "Fast."

===========================================================

Tenchi felt strong fingers lock around his wrist…

"Whooaa!" He exclaimed, as he was jerked forward, causing him to
tumble over the spy’s shoulder.

"Oh, it’s you." An upside down Kova looked at him, not unkindly, but
not happily either. "I’m sorry, but I do not appreciate anyone
touching me, especially if the person is coming from behind."
Although he was addressing Tenchi, his eyes were distant, staring
out in the distance, over the carrot fields, beyond the hills shrouded
in the vibrant flora of summer, across the horizon, into the cerulean
morning sky. Unlike just a moment ago when he had wished them
good morning, he no longer had a faint smile hovering on his face,
but was just plain grave.

Tenchi took his proffered hand and righted himself. "You seem
upset."

"Maybe. Who knows?"

"Kiyone?" Tenchi felt like he was stepping on thin ice, as Kova
looked so distant and cold, his expression both brittle and empty.

"Likely."

Tenchi settled down beside him, watching the distant scenery.

You love her, don’t you? But that was such a stupid thing to say,
which also goes to show caution does affect Tenchi’s mind, if only
making him a little smarter.

"What happened?"

"Nothing." 

Tenchi thought he saw Kova’s expression harden. "You mind?"

"All she had to do was say yes."

Tenchi’s mind reeled in surprise. In his opinion, if Kiyone did not say
yes, she would not wake up beside you on the floor. Probably with
you decorating various parts of the room, maybe, but not with you by
her side.

Something clicked in his mind. "Erm, what did you ask her?"

Kova stared at him, his expression a mix of annoyance and
confusion. "It’s none of your…"

What was wrong with telling him, Tenchi was quite possibly the
nicest a guy could get, I have nothing to lose and he won’t harm
me…

Tenchi watched as Kova closed his eyes, almost wearily. "I wanted
her to promise she would get on without me." He sighed, his fringe
wavering slightly before his breath. "She refused."

Tenchi tried, but he could not stop himself on time. "You *what*!?"
Young though he was, he knew enough about the average man to
know about the existence of hormones and their strength.

"Yeah, and she didn’t let me." He murmured, almost to himself.
Another soft breath of what sounded like sorrow, then Kova dunked
himself back on the grass, stretching the full length of his body, his
eyes still closed restfully.

"I’m sorry." Tenchi’s mind mustered itself. He wasn’t used to dealing
with such strange things.

So there isn’t just one Tenchi, is there?

"Well, if it’s any consolation, I just wonder…" His voice was distant,
his strained features softened, as the blue hair seemed to stir, as if
touched by a breath of fresh air, and his eyelids seemed no longer
pressed tightly together, but just gently closed. "…if she will love our
wedding night that much more for it all." A tender smile played on his
face for a moment, and Tenchi suddenly felt as though he gazed, not
merely upon Kova, but almost as if some angel had decided to stop
by within the man, before it vanished again, the ephemeral touch of
light from some far away hope. "How I wonder…"

He watched the figure before him, trying to envisage the world Kova
was looking into, wishing he could see that far ahead. Or was it *too*
far ahead…? 

"I’m sure you’ll make it, Kova."

"Thank you, Tenchi." He whispered. "Once again I’m in your debt."

Tenchi nodded.

"How about you, Ryoko and Aeka?"

He blinked, surprised. "Well, things have been the same as ever.
They still try to fight, but I think I put one over them a while ago."

"Good for you. You’ll learn." He nodded, glad for the distraction.
"Unless you have decided who to choose yet, which I genuinely
doubt." A pause, "*Who* are you going to choose anyway?"

Another stretch of long silence. "I don’t know. Honestly."

"Would you take both of them?"

Tenchi nodded. "But only if they could be happy with that."

"I see."

"Could you do us a favour, Kova?"

"Hmm? How?"

"Cook? Lunch and dinner?"

He thought a bit, considering its value as a distraction, and nodded.
"Yeah, no problem."

===========================================================

"Destination Solar System, ETA 40 minutes."

"That’s ‘real’ good," he sat back, stretching again. His co pilot looked
back at him, with his fingers dancing recklessly around the small
gun. His green eyes were dead and weary, and he looked as if he
had drunk several pints too much. "Can’t you <hic!> make Midorishu
go any faster?"

"Believe me, Number 231, I’m doing my best." The person steering
retorted. "Why don’t you pick someone else next time?"

His brows knitted in annoyance. "You know damned well why I
chose you. You knew her well, better than I ever could." His hands
raised the bottle to his lips. "Plus you were blacklisted, and this
could be the only way you’re going to get your big break."

Of course I know that, you idiot! If it weren’t for that, I’d report for you
for insubordination, theft and letting personal interests interfere with
your duties!

"I know, I know." The ship slowed as they drew closer to the Solar
System, no longer travelling at interspace travel speeds, as caution
demands. "I hope this works, or I am finished."

"Yeah right, like I give a damn." He said. "I just hope she’s fine." The
emerald eyes dimmed. "I just *pray*."

"If she’s not?" The co pilot seemed cheered by the prospect, but she
took care not to let it show.

"Then someone will have *hell* to pay."

===========================================================

It was late afternoon, and Washu watched in satisfaction as the
readout was confirmed, regarding the co-ordinates of the bridge of
the Yagami. Engaging several systems, she selected the matter
transportation sequence, and pressed some more at her terminal,
creating a large section of blank space in her lab.

She smiled at her handiwork as the control room materialised in the
lab, fitting the dimensions nicely. A couple of elementary link ups,
and the Yagami’s darkened bridge lighted up. Washu picked up a
device and left the lab.

"What’s that, Washu?" Tenchi and Kova asked simultaneously, as
the spy put down the phone. Tenchi had just directed him towards
applying for a new apartment.

"This?" Washu raised the mini transmission device up. "It’s to allow
Yagami to receive or send transmissions into this dimension while
remaining in my lab."

"You’ve fixed it already?" Kova looked incredulous.

Washu nodded, pleasure dancing in her eyes at Kova’s inadvertent
admission of her superiority. "I’ve set up the bridge and this opens
up the communications, though it was nothing much really, much of
the front of the Yagami was left intact, just a few minor patches here
and there, which is really less than no trouble for a scientist as smart
as me!" Washu beamed.

"So you…?"

"Yup, when Kiyone comes back she will be able to contact her HQ."

Tenchi saw Kova’s face darken at the thought, while Washu
conducted herself to the outside, seemingly oblivious to anything.
Then the spy shook his head, and returned to his terminal.

"What are you doing?"

"Configuring this terminal to do body scans. I could use it for my
future practice." Kova had requested the laptop from Washu when
she praised him for the fine lunch he cooked, which Sasami had
helped improve by adding condiments to it, although she did not
cook . Unfortunately, he was still upset about when Kiyone had
called back to say they were not eating, having been forced to do
overtime for the very late arrival at the Steel Enterprises, as well as
taking a pay cut for yesterday’s absence.

She would have loved it. Even though I’ve kept it for them, it wouldn’t
be the same.

"I see." Tenchi sat back, recalling how Kova’s expression had
darkened when Washu went by. "Are you worried about the GP?"

"Don’t you have something else to do, Tenchi?" He muttered. It was
so hard to concentrate, to try to lose himself in his task in order to
temporarily forget his problems, but here Tenchi was going on and
on. "I’m sure Aeka and Ryoko would be only too happy to oblige…"

"Oh, they went to the city via Kiyone’s apartment for shopping." He
replied. "They said they had some sorting out to do." It was a fair
price to hand over his wallet and account card to Aeka (not Ryoko!),
in return for a more peaceful, albeit lonely, afternoon. Although they
promised they wouldn’t fight, and seemed rather glad to be alone
with each other to discuss and buy whatever they needed, he had
some nagging doubts, so he had asked Sasami to go along, and the
two girls didn’t seem to mind.

"I see. Why didn’t you join them?"

"They didn’t ask me to, actually." That was a rather strong hint that
they wanted some time without him following them. "I thought they
might not have appreciated my presence."

"Growing wiser already, Tenchi." Kova smiled slightly, eyes not
leaving his laptop.

"Maybe," he tried to fathom Kova’s expression. "Worried about
Kiyone?"

A silver blur arced out and struck the unsuspecting Tenchi on the
head. "OW!"

"Not wise enough," Kova tossed his weapon up and down in one
hand, as the other hand continued entering commands.. Tenchi,
rubbing his head, decided he had best leave the man be.

Just before Kova returned to his self-appointed task, a thought
struck him. It would not have been beyond Tenchi’s rights to order
him out of the house for hitting and bullying him, but somehow the
boy seemed to be able to take it all in his stride.

He shook his head and smiled.

Tenchi is quite possibly the kindest soul alive.

===========================================================

"Excuse me a moment!" Kiyone hurried out from behind the counter,
rushing to the sound of the beeping from her GP alert ring.

Washu must have fixed up Yagami, and there’s a transmission for
me!

"Hey!" The manager shouted.

"You can forget about my pay for today!" She glanced back at
Mihoshi who was about to leave too. "Mihoshi, stay! We need the
money!"

"But Kiyone…"

"You stay here till our shift is over, it’s only half an hour more, okay?"

Mihoshi looked glum.

"Please, Mihoshi…" Kiyone begged. "We’ve already got docked pay
from this morning, any less and we shan’t even be able to afford the
rent on our apartment."

Mihoshi sighed, and nodded glumly. The manager didn’t seem at all
satisfied, but there was nothing more that could be said before
Kiyone disappeared into the toilet, then emerging seconds later in
her standard GP uniform, tossing the restaurant staff outfit onto the
counter and vanishing out the door.

===========================================================

‘Acknowledgement detected from Earth, source Yagami.’

The officer sat back with a sigh of relief, and he felt tears of joy form
in his eyes.

She’s alive!

Kiyone’s face appeared on the screen. "2nd Class Chief Inspector
Kiyone Makibi reporting."

"Galaxy Police Special Forces Operative number 231 here." 

The officer in question had a handsome, almost feline, face with high
cheekbones and sharp chin, red a little from drinking, topped with
emerald eyes that seemed to radiate warmth at her, and had a wet,
glistening shine in them. But the strangest thing was that the man
had a head of fine dark green hair, practically identical to her own,
which were parted, with a long lock of hair curling down past the left
half of his face, while the hair on the right side of his parting was tied
and flowing down the back of his neck.

"Excuse me, Operative 231, but have I seen you before?"

The man smiled warmly, his expression oddly familiar, reminiscent of
the time Kova opened the escape capsule, only more controlled and
less obvious. "You have always been very sharp, Chief Inspector."
His face lighted up meaningfully. "Maybe we could find time to
talk…"

"Maybe." Kiyone licked her lips. She was still upset with Kova for the
previous night, as well as the morning, but… "But I have to warn you
I’m not very open to such propositions at this point in time."

"That won’t be a problem," he grinned. He *was* handsome, and
Kiyone felt almost sure that if she had met him earlier she should
have fallen for him, but for some reason, she just found the very
notion as impossible and alien as falling for her…

"Put her through, number 231!" A voice sounded sharply from the
other side of the tranmission, disrupting her train of thoughts before
she could complete it.

The SpecOp frowned... "Hey, give me some more time with her!" He
seemed to be speaking to someone else.

"No! The Section Chief has said he wished to speak to her, ASAP!"
The voice sounded familiar.

"Look, I am the superior officer here…"

"And I can crash your precious Midorishu if I want." Kiyone tried to
remember the female voice.

"You wouldn’t dare." The operative looked angrily. "I’d rip your arm
off if you…"

"Yeah, and get stranded in space." 

Kiyone finally recalled it. "Mitsuki?"

The unseen person lowered her face from standing by the SpecOp,
and sure enough, the thin brunette’s pointed face showed up. The
officer seated seemed to edge away from her, not nervously, but in
dislike. "I’m so happy to see you’re fine, Kiyone!" She waved, her
face too glad to be the person arguing a moment ago. "You’re as
sharp as ever."

"Glad you noticed." Kiyone responded drily. She had never quite
forgiven Mitsuki for the attempted arrest on her back at HQ, and had
noted that through all the time Mitsuki served her after the Kagato
episode the officer always put up a satisfied, fawning front, while
becoming disgruntled and grumbling when she thought she was
alone. "Don’t smile till your face splits!" She replied too cheerily,
while mentally noting that would be an improvement for Mitsuki

The officer in the background smirked, clearly noting the abundance
of ‘feeling’ Kiyone shared with him with regards to 1st class detective
Mitsuki.

"All right, I’ll put you through to the HQ now!" Mitsuki, seizing
advantage her proximity to the transmission controls, quickly
pressed the button, the pleasure not fading from her face for an
instant. Kiyone thought she saw number 231’s face contort in fury as
he pulled her back and away, before the transmission from the
Midorishu was cut off.

Half a second later, the Section Chief’s face flashed onto the screen.
"Oh, it’s you, Chief Inspector Kiyone!" His eyes darted around her.
"Where’s your partner Mihoshi?"

"She is currently not available, sir. This report will be submitted by
me alone." As she said that she could hear someone tapping his foot
softly behind, as if to make his presence known, before subsiding
into silence as she stopped talking.

If that was Washu, she would just have shouted. So it must be *him*.

"All right. What happened?"

"The Yagami was attacked by the SSS shuttle, but me and Mihoshi
managed to get out before the ship blew up. Washu was the one who
got the bridge up and running again, but I’m afraid it will be quite a
while, sir, before the Yagami can be put out to space again."

"Hmm, you seem to have been very lucky." He nodded.

"Pardon my interruption sir, but I have reason to believe the Synera
Stellar Syndicate is the one that attacked the Yagami and should not
be trusted."

"I’m sorry, but I understood that the shuttles were controlled by
some space pirates, were they not?" His expression hardened.
"Specifically a certain Kova Kashiro."

"After destroying the Yagami, the shuttle returned to the Comet. If
there truly were space pirates on board, how could that be
possible?"

Mitsuki and the Operative stared at the two ongoing transmissions,
noting Kiyone’s strained expression. Mitsuki shook her head. "Poor
Kiyone. All the work must be affecting her head."

"Shut up, bitch." Operative 231 murmured. "I still have a bone to pick
with you for cutting me off from her."

Back before Kiyone, the Section Chief shook his head. "I’m sorry,
but I have certain information about the abilities of the Comet, which
states they can overrule their own shuttle controls within a certain
radius of the Comet, so after you slowed them down, they managed
to get in range."

"But I have very strong reasons to believe the personnel on board
the Comet were…"

"Yes, we have evidence that the above mentioned space pirate crept
on board the ship, and impersonated the captain of the Comet, thus
causing some regrettable violence on board the Comet." He waved a
slim file at Kiyone. "It’s all here in the report from the Comet’s crew."

Kiyone heard a low snarl behind her. "But sir! I have people here,
Tenchi, professor Washu, princess Aeka, they can all substantiate
my evidence!"

The Section Chief nodded comfortingly. "I believe you, Kiyone. In
terms of events, your view coincides precisely of that in this report."
His tone was cool, assuaging but still skeptical. "But there are events
that you are not aware of. By all accounts, in fact my personal
experience, the Comet’s Captain was in a shuttle outside the ship at
the time of all those things happening, so how could it possibly be
him?"

Kiyone ground her teeth together, trying not to let her rage show.
"With all due respect sir, why do you need me to submit a report
when you already have what you need?"

The Chief’s eyebrows drew together, his demeanour clearly
dissatisfied. "Firstly, it is my duty to ensure the safety of all my
officers. Secondly, I need to know how you and your partner
survived the Yagami’s destruction and what happened to the ship. I
also need to know how your assignment is going."

"Assignment?" Kiyone looked up for a moment, then she
remembered.

Kova’s eyes narrowed as he saw her tremble slightly, before
composing herself and carrying on as if nothing happened.

"She will have nothing to worry about once I get there." The
Operative mumbled to himself, flexing his arm muscles, and his
rippling biceps showed even through his uniform.

"Maybe," Mitsuki commented. "Kiyone doesn’t scare easily, and if
she is that worried, you’d better be prepared for a tough time,
whatever this Kova Kashiro guy is."

"Bring ‘em on!" The officer slammed his right fist into his other palm,
and cracked his knuckles belligerently. "I’d like to see them take me
out."

Mitsuki nodded, her mind chiming silently, ‘So would I.’

Kiyone took a deep breath and continued. "I’m afraid we have been
unable to apprehend the criminal, even with aid from Washu and
Tenchi. Fortunately, we are aware of his whereabouts…" Kiyone
ignored another snort of derision from behind. "… and are currently
seeking a peaceful compromise with him."

"What? What compromise is there!?" The Chief growled. "He
destroyed your ship, engineered an encounter between you and the
Synereans, causing injury to some of you and resulting in the deaths
of over sixty good marines! And you still wish to compromise?"

"Sir, I think…"

"Officer Kiyone Makibi, I’m afraid you have been working too hard.
That man is dangerous, he can wear a myriad of faces, put on
countless fronts! How can you even think of parleying with him?"
His expression was incredulous. 

Kiyone closed her eyes as she heard knuckles crack behind her.

Kova, please, get out of here!

"We might be able to…"

"NO!" The Chief replied. "It is written, clear as crystal, this man must
be eliminated at all costs. The SSS no longer require him to be
captured, as long as proof of his death is presented. Such is his
record and the stakes that there are no terms you can offer him.
Either by our hands or by the hands of the SSS, only death awaits
him, and there is nothing to be said about that. As for you, you are to
do your best in apprehending him, and if necessary eliminate him if
he resists."

How *dare* you talk about him like he was just another dangerous
pest to be exterminated!?

Kiyone’s eyes narrowed imperceptibly, before she stood up, her face
full of anger

"I will NOT!" She shouted at the Chief. "He is *NOT* a heartless
criminal!"

Mitsuki felt her mind laugh with glee. 

At last, Kiyone, at last, you make a mistake…

"You forget yourself, Chief Inspector." The Chief’s eyes grew cold
and his expression hardened. "I will *not* have you endangering
your own and your partner’s lives on this futile crusade of
conversion." His bearing became authoritarian, as Kiyone recovered
her wits.

Oh no, what have I done!? She heard herself cry inside.

The Chief read out his verdict. "I hereby declare you unfit for further
overseeing or execution of this assignment. You are relieved of
command over the assignment to capture Kova Kashiro, and shall
be replaced by Special Operative Number 231, who is in transit to the
System, along with his pilot 1st class detective Mitsuki."

"Sir!" She tried. "There…"

"…is no room for further discussion, unless you succeed in
apprehending him without any strings attached, as there are none
that you are authorised to deploy." His eyes were grim and impatient.
"You are to have no say in the decisions made by Operative 231, and
are to assist him to the best of your capabilities in this mission. If by
any chance he orders you to do something, you are to obey him to
the letter. Any direct insubordination will be reported and will have
standard repercussions, including demotion." Kiyone flinched a little
at that remark. "Should your team succeed, you shall be duly
rewarded, *with* consideration of this small episode."

Kiyone sagged back in her seat, her face distraught.

How am I going to save him? Isn’t there a way to avoid trying to hurt
him?

"Do I make myself clear, Chief Inspector?"

"Y…yes." A long pause, her voice tremulous. "Sir."

"Any final questions?"

"If I find a way to avoid bloodshed in this?" Kiyone pleaded.

"They should not be considered at all unless it involves total
incarceration of the criminal so that he has no ability to endanger any
one on this assignment. If there are any such complete surrenders,
report them to Operative 231, he will decide this criminal’s fate."

Kiyone’s brows knitted again. "He is *not*…"

"QUIET! You are no longer in charge of this assignment, and don’t
you dare presume to give me orders like that!" He told her, then his
eyes widened. Mitsuki and Operative 231 also stared.

Kiyone felt her body grow cold as a chill point metal pressed hard on
her temple.

"…Kova-chan?" Her lips barely moved, and the people watching the
transmission could not make out the soft sound.

The grim figure standing beside her, invisible to the Midorishu and
the Section Chief, remained silent.

Faster than thought, Kiyone was thrown off the seat, away from the
metal rod, as her GP Blaster held by the unknown assailant shot out
a gold laser, and she heard a voice like her own scream out in pain
as the beam skimmed over her head.

"Kiyone!" Operative 231 cried out, anger, apprehension and anguish
permeating his voice, and was heard only by the stunned Mitsuki.

Kova’s face, devoid of human feeling, appeared on the transmission
screen. "I fulfil your request, Chief." His eyes blazed in fury. "She
won’t ever have to report to you again."

The Section Chief and the inmates of the Midorishu could only watch
as the transmission from the Yagami was cut off, as well as Kiyone’s
fresh scream of agony.

NOTES:
Kova is in a way, an SIed character. Pls include him in your
comments, whether I have portrayed him as a person, as a friend
or foe, as one of the gang, and most importantly, as a human being.
I have some pictures of him, not too good pencil drawings, if you
wish to take a look pls mail me.

I have decided to continue writing chapters at this length

The start of this chapter is a little anti-climactic, action
wise, and there is a lot more before Darkness and Light ends.  
I have reason to believe the ending WILL be climactic, for 
those of you disappointed. Operative 231 is a character 
created by someone else, whose identity will be seen in Chap 
13 and full credits will go to that author at the end of the 
next chapter.

Chapter 13 may emerge, but that is the furthest I *can* go 
(ie unfinished story), my preliminary exams are drawing near, 
probably won't continuing until my preliminary exams end 
September 20th or so... after that I have to prepare for my 
A levels, but I will try to bring out more chapters. No matter 
what, I will try to finish it once my A's are over, which is 
in late Nov/early Dec.

I hope you have enjoyed this Fanfic as much as I have typing it.
If there are any more grammar errors, I beg your forgiveness, as
my sole proofreader is myself.

This is my first FF, so go ahead and mail me at zyraen@yahoo.com
with comments, especially on character portrayal, realism.

Last word : PLEASE REVIEW! So I noe which hits are for real & 
which are merely misgotten clicks...
