~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~
This story takes place right after part one of No Need For Zero, but I 
put in the last paragraph so it would make sense.
~No Need For Zero: Part 2~
~No Need For An Old Friend~
~At The Celebration~

	"Where is Tenchi and Ryoko!" claimed Ayeka.   (She better not have 
seduced him or hurt him anyway!)  As if they heard her question, Tenchi 
and Ryoko came out of the trees, holding hands and smiling at each 
other.  (Oh no. I'm too late.... But somehow in my heart I knew this was 
going to happen...Tenchi has made his choice.)
	"Tenchi! Ryoko! There you are I didn't let anyone eat until you 
came!" said Sasami.
	"Tenchi," Ayeka said to him quietly," I just want you to know that 
I am happy for you that you have chosen Ryoko, and I wish you happy 
times. But can I ask you a favor?"
	"Anything, Ayeka."
	"May Sasami and I stay here with you on earth?  I don't like the 
royal life and Earth is so peaceful.  We would continue our chores and 
help as much as we can to help around."
	"Of course Ayeka.  I would never throw you out."
	"Thank you Lord Tenchi.  Your kindness means much to me." 
	Just then a song started up, a slow one, and Tenchi walked over to 
Ryoko, who know looked gentler than she had been the last year, picked 
her up and started to dance under the tree grove, as Ryoko laughed and 
smiled.  This was her life, the life she never had in her dark days with 
Kagato.  But know that he is dead she tries to forget him and make in 
the past.  If she never met Tenchi she would probably still be under his 
control.  The thought made her tremble.
	"What's wrong Ryoko?"
	"Oh nothing Tenchi I'm just a little cold." she smiled at him.
	"OH! Here's my jacket"
	"Thank you Tenchi."  Yes, this was the life for her.  A peaceful 
and happy life with lots of friends around and of course the man she 
loved. Love.  *sigh* I never knew what love was until I met Tenchi.  
Thank you Tenchi, Ayeka, Yosho, everyone for giving me this life.  She 
smiled as a tear trickled down her face.  (Oh why am I crying...This is 
a happy night!)  
	Peaceful was the night, that night, there were happy faces 
everywhere, games being played, songs being sung, and the two happiest 
people ever.  But what none of them knew was that someone.... somewhere 
was watching and waiting to get their chance for revenge.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	"Get up sleepy head...Tenchi.... wake up."
	Tenchi opened his eyes to find Ryoko, still in her pajamas 
floating over him.
	"Ryoko, what time is it?"
	"It's 5:00, I want to show you something." she smiled. He smiled 
back sleepily.
	"Alright." So Ryoko took Tenchi and phazed to the front porch.
	"Ryoko, what's.... mph."?
	"Shh, watch."  She said as she covered his mouth.  They both 
stared out into the horizon for a minute or two.  Then the sun began to 
rise.
	"This is what I wanted to show you.  Every morning as I waited for 
you to wake up I would watch the sun rise.  It's so beautiful isn't it 
Tenchi."  He nodded.
	Ayeka was also up watching the sunrise from her window.  Her heart 
was crying in pain as she watched Ryoko lying in Tenchi's arms so 
lovingly.  Although she tried to accept the fact that Ryoko was with 
Tenchi, she still felt strongly for him.
	"Ayeka?" she jumped at the call of her name, and turned around to 
find Sasami looking at her with groggy eyes.
	"Oh, yes Sasami?"
	"I am going down to start breakfast now"
	"Oh, I was going to ask you if I could help this morning."
	"Of course sister!" Her face lit up at the thought of her sister 
helping cook.  "I'll go start heating the oven."
	Ayeka watched silently as her sister hopped out of the room and 
down stairs to start breakfast.  (*sigh* oh Tenchi...)  So Ayeka soon 
followed her sister, with one last glance at Ryoko and Tenchi.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	"Tenchi, what are you thinking about?"
	"Hm?  Oh, about how crazy I used to think my life was.  From going 
to school like any normal boy, to traveling across space, running from 
the galactic police, and defeating Kagato."  Tenchi felt Ryoko shiver at 
the sound of Kagato.
	"But Tenchi, we had fun right?"
	"Ryoko being here with all of you girls is better than any normal 
life.  Being with you alone is best of all."  She blushed 
	"We should probably go inside, Tenchi, everyone should be waking 
up soon."
	"They can wait a few minutes."  He smiled, and she smiled back.
	"Oh! Hi Tenchi, hi Ryoko.  Good morning.  Breakfast should be 
ready soon."
	"Thank you Sasami."
	Sasami bounced off to the shack to get some carrots for Ryo-Ohki.  
(I'm so glad Ryoko is happy.  She hasn't smiled for a while!)
	"Ryo-Ohki, time to gather some carrots!"
	"Mrow!"
	After Sasami got some carrots she headed back for the house.  She 
noticed that Ryoko and Tenchi left too.  Once she entered the house she 
was surprised that everyone was already sitting at the table ready for 
breakfast.  "Well Good morning everyone!"  She giggled.  "Ayeka helped 
me cook this morning, I hope you all like my breakfast."
	"We always do Sasami." 
	"Thank you Kiyone." she giggled again.  Like the day before Ryoko 
wasn't stuffing everything she could see in her mouth.  A few people 
noticed that and were very pleased that she stayed for the whole meal.
	"Tenchi, after breakfast may I see you in my lad?"
	"Sure Washu." He had an idea what she wanted to talk to him about.  
It was about the Ryoko/Zero incident that happened yesterday.  It was 
Washu that discovered it.  The others were never told and didn't find 
out about it.  But Tenchi wondered if any of them noticed her 
continuance of the behavior she displayed yesterday.  Although she 
doesn't giggle and blush everytime Tenchi says something to her, she is 
still polite and gentler.  He suddenly becomes worried when he realizes 
that maybe Ryoko fully changed and lost her powers.  He had an idea, he 
would ask her to come help him with his training and see if she could 
still use her powers.  But for now he realizes it's time to go to 
washu's lab now that breakfast is over. 
	*KNOCK*  "Little Washu...Little Washu..."
	"Come in Tenchi.  I see Ryoko is back!  Although I already knew 
that because of my super genius machine!  HAHAHA!  Well as you know 
Ryoko has changed, she is now gentler and lost her vicious ways.  But 
don't be fooled at the time of danger she will be able to protect 
herself.  My machine informs me that you are worried about Ryoko losing 
her powers.  Well she hasn't lost them thankfully, only hid them.  
Tenchi, you have brought out the real her.  Her old ways have been 
placed behind thanks to you.  You set her free!  Now that is all I wish 
to say.  I have much work to do so, thank you for talking to me!"
	"uh ya...."  He left the lab in a daze.  (What talk...I listened 
the whole time.  But What Washu said did help alot.  Ryoko still has her 
powers she is only.... hiding...them.  Hm)
	"Tenchi, It's time for you to train!"
	"I hope I can concentrate with everything on my mind..."
	""Tenchi, I thought today we would train the mind instead of the 
body."
	"The mind?"
	"Yes, a warrior is not only fit in the body but powerful and calm 
in the mind and soul."
	"But how doe train my mind?"
	"I will teach how to meditate.  First come sit over here under the 
tree, and then sit cross-legged with your back straight.  You should 
start by just breathing in and out.  Now let your mind float."
	"Grandfather?"
	"What I mean is try not to think about anything but take in what's 
around you.  You should be able to hear wind, leaves rustle, the beating 
of a butterfly's wings."
	(Oh great the day when I'm not supposed to think..."
	"Tenchi I feel you are not meditating."
	"Yes grandfather."
	Ryoko was just about to take Ryo-Ohki carrot hunting, when she saw 
Tenchi and Yosho sitting on the floor.  (What are they doing?)  But 
Tenchi looked so peaceful that she started to zone out herself, and 
meditate.  She soon heard the wind, leaves rustle, the beating of 
butterfly's wings, and, what not even Washu knew this would happen, she 
could hear Tenchi's breathing, his thoughts, and his heart.  She 
suddenly awoke to reality and fell on the ground in shock of this 
discovery.  Tenchi also feeling the shock awoke and was shocked.
	"Grandfather, what was that?!"
	"It was the peaceful feeling of meditation."  Yosho did not 
realize that Tenchi had just formed a mental connection with Ryoko.  
Tenchi also didn't realize it.  But Ryoko did.  She was scared about her 
new power that she quickly took Ryo-Ohki and fled to the carrot patch.
	"Excuse me grandfather."  He saw Ryoko run off and was confused.  
So he ran after her with concern.  "Ryoko!"
	"Tenchi" Tenchi saw the fear in her eyes.
	"Ryoko..what is it?"
	"You didn't feel it?"
	"Was it you..?"
	"I saw you sitting on the ground with your eyes closed and I just 
concentrated on watching you, when I all of a sudden I heard the wind 
and leaves and I heard...you.."
	"What do you mean?"
	"Tenchi, I heard your emotions, your breathing and your heart."
	"You...hear...heard my emotions?"
	"I mean I could feel all your emotions...It was like I was feeling 
them too."
	"I think we need to talk to Washu.
	"Yes I think that would solve our confusion.  As Tenchi walked 
next to Ryoko he tried to figure out what just happened in filed but 
none of it would make sense to him.  He figured it was best to let Washu 
explain it to him, which would probably still confuse him with her 
scientific words and all.  Ryoko dropped Ryo-Ohki with Sasami, and 
mentioned that she was going to talk to Washu.
	"Little Washu...little Washu..?
	"Come in Tenchi."
	"Oh I see Ryoko is with you."
	"Ya, uh well its hard.."
	"Me and Tenchi just a weird connection and were asking you to 
explain it."
	"Thanks Ryoko."
	"Well there's nothing a genius like me can't solve...hehehehe"
	"You're a genius Washu!  Hurray for Washu!  YAAA!"
	"Hehehe, well explain what happened."  So Ryoko and Tenchi told 
their story to Washu.
	"Hm.. It seems that both your minds have realized your bond, and 
have combined to form a mental bond!"
	"A mental bond?"
	"Yes, you have both realized you can feel each others emotions.  
And you will soon realize you can communicate with this bond"
	"Thank you miss Washu."
	"Any time Tenchi!! hehehe"
	"Well Tenchi what do ya think about all this?"
	"Ugh, all of this excitement is making me tired and confused."
	"Oh, Tenchi."
	"I'm going to sleep on it" With that Tenchi gave Ryoko a kiss on 
the cheek and left to think about what just happened.
	(Maybe I should do a little thinking sleep myself.)  Ryoko walked 
off to the tree grove again.  These trees were thinking spot, ever since 
Tenchi released Ryoko from the cave she would come here to think.  The 
cave brought back too many sad memories.  (Memories!!  The 
song...Tenchi's mother used to sing it to him.... that's how I know 
it....) so she started humming the tune to herself.  But once she 
started a vision of Tenchi and his mother flashed before her...He was 
running from something when he fell and started to cry.  Soon a woman 
walked over to Tenchi and picked him up.  She told him he would be ok 
and everything was fine.  The little boy looked up the woman with 
confused eyes and said ok.  Then the vision ended.  (Why...did..*sigh*)  
"I can't even spend ten minutes without wanting to see Tenchi...."
	Up in Tenchi's room, Tenchi was doing some serious memory thinking 
too.  He started thinking about life was.  So simple, so peaceful, and 
...well boring.  He was glad Ryoko and the others came into his life.  
Then a vision flashed before him.  It was a small boy running from 
something when he fell and started to cry.  Soon a woman walked over to 
the little boy and picked him up.  She told him he would be ok and 
everything was fine.  The little boy looked up the woman with confused 
eyes and said ok.  Then the vision ended.  (Was...that....)?  He started 
to get misty-eyed at the remembrance of his mother. "I can't even think 
straight with Ryoko on my mind..." Soon Ryoko phazed next to him in his 
room.
	"Tenchi!  I couldn't stand just sitting out there without you!"
	"I know..."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	"Tonight I'm going to make a special dinner!  For the occasion of 
happy times!!!"
	"That sounds nice Sasami"
	"But of course it won't be as nice as last nights dinner!! 
Hehehe."
	"Oh, yes...last night..."  Ayeka suddenly remembered the scene of 
last night.  While she was worrying about the whereabouts of Tenchi, he 
was confessing his love for Ryoko. *sigh* She remembered seeing them 
with joy in there eyes when walking out of the trees.  She remembered 
the love in Ryoko's eyes when Tenchi took her and spun her around.  (Oh, 
Tenchi, why couldn't it be me....)
	"Ayeka could you get me the pepper.... Ayeka.... Ayeka..??"
	"Oh yes Sasami.."  (I must stop having these wishful thoughts.  
Tenchi made his choice; not a good one but I must respect that.)  Then 
she remembered from yesterday when Tenchi yelled at her.  She thought 
Ryoko was planning some trick when she suddenly became polite and kind.   
^^Ayeka, Ryoko was only trying to be nice and you had no right to yell 
at her like that! I thought you, being a princess, would respect that^^ 
what he said hurt more than anything.  (I guess my harsh words made him 
decide Ryoko was kind and right for him after all!  But I must put this 
matter behind!)
	"Ayeka would you please gather everyone for dinner?"
	"Yes, Sasami."  She called over to the couch for Mihoshi and 
Kiyone, she told Washu at her lab, found Niboyuki in his room, and Yosho 
at the shrine. "I must find Tenchi and Ryoko..." She hoped dearly that 
she wouldn't find them together.  She went first to Ryoko's room, but 
unfortunately she wasn't there.  (Tenchi's room...)
	"Tenchi.... Tenchi..?"  She quietly opened his door, and as she 
expected she found both of them...They were outside on the deck, his arm 
was around her and her head rested peacefully on his shoulder.  She 
choked on her tears as she tried to force them down.  "Um...excuse 
me..."
	"Oh Ayeka."  Tenchi took his arm off of Ryoko, but she still laid 
her head on his shoulder."
	"Sasami told me to inform you that dinner is ready."
	"Thank you miss Ayeka."
	She quickly ran out of his room and into hers to calm down.  (I 
mustn't arrive at dinner in tears.)  She tried so hard not to cry, and 
only when Sasami called her down did she arrive.
	"Sasami this looks wonderful."
	"Thank you Mr. Masaki"
	Once again dinner was a happy time for everyone at the Masaki 
house, but...someone...somewhere was still preparing for 
...something....
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	"Today I must practice, I haven't for two days considering my 
condition and state."
	"Ok Tenchi, but don't be long, and don't hurt yourself!"  
Hopefully she could concentrate today to sort things out.  But what was 
to sort!  She finally had Tenchi!!  Everything was perfect!  Nothing 
could go wrong here.  Not now, not ever!
	"Mrow, mrow!!"
	"What is it Ryo-Ohki? Ye...what is.....OH no!!!  A strange but 
familiar ship broke in to the earth's atmosphere and started to land 
near the Masaki house.  "Wha....Ken-Ohki..."  Ryo-Ohki hearing the old 
ship's name cried out in joy.  That's when Tenchi felt it...what Ryoko 
said, he could feel her thoughts.  He felt fear and pain with torment.  
(Ryoko...) he stopped and looked around.
	"No, Tenchi...I must talk to her."  Her voice cracked with fear 
when she said this.  "It's Nagi and she has come again for me..."
	"Ryoko, so good to see you didn't die....hahaha"
	"Well, you know me Nagi, I don't age and get fat, as I see you 
did."
	"Hm...You do seem to remember that fight you promised me...it was 
a while ago wasn't it Ryoko."  Yes, Ryoko remembered that day; it was 
the day she confessed her love to Tenchi right before he fought Kagato.  
She risked her life just to take him there.  That day before Ryoko left 
Nagi made her promise not to die so they could fight.  She didn't expect 
Nagi to return to earth just to claim the fight."
	"Well, Nagi what do you want me to do."
	"I challenge you!"
	"Well I figured that, now when?"
	"Two days from now in a field of your choice we will battle for 
the final time."
	"You got it."
	"Now I must return to my ship to prepare for our battle."
	"Ryoko.... what are you thinking?!?!"
	"Now Tenchi you don't think I can win?"
	"Well the last you fought her you had trouble!"
	"But I have been practicing...."
	"Ryoko!  What is...It's Ken-Ohki!!!"
	"Sasami don't get too close to that ship!"
	"Ryoko now what problems did you cause us."
	"Now Ayeka all I did was stand here and then this ship showed up 
and Nagi."
	"NAGI!!!!!"
	"Yes Nagi, she challenged me to a battle in two days."  Ryoko 
could feel Tenchi tense up when she said the word battle.  She also felt 
his hope and faith for her. (Just when everything was going good.  I 
guess I spoke too soon!  This better be the last time!)
	"Ryoko what are you going to do?"
	"Well, kid it seems that the old lady wants to play.  So we're 
going to play!  Washu can you developed a place for us?"
	"*sigh*  Yes Ryoko, I was hoping Nagi would disappear..."
	"Don't worry, this WILL be the last time!"
	"Ryoko...."
	"Tenchi don't worry for me.  But you can help me prepare for 
this."  He nodded.  
	
	Over the next two days Tenchi helped Ryoko prepare for the battle 
with her old friend, Nagi.  Everyone made sure that these days were 
happy ones for her, from fear that they would be the last.   Even Ayeka 
was worried for her dear friend, Ryoko.  On the last night Tenchi 
confronted Ryoko.
	"Ryoko,"
	"Yes Tenchi dear?"  They were in the tree grove of course, it 
brought back happy times for both of them.
	"Ryoko, I.."
	"Tenchi, do not worry for me, I'll be fine,"
	"But, uh, I don't want to loose you!  Just a few days ago did I 
finally realize I loved you, and I'm afraid you will be taken away from 
me!"
	"Tenchi, your love and faith in me will guide me tomorrow."
	(She sounds so strong and faithful, so why can't I!!)
	(He worries about me....Nagi..I will not loose to you!)
	Tenchi felt her anger and quickly took her in a tight embrace.
	"Ryoko I love you, and I won't know what to do without you."
	"I love you too, and you won't have to!"  They stood there in 
their embrace for what seemed like an eternity, but soon...morning 
came...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	"Ah, Ryoko so good to see you again.  Are you ready?"
	"Same for you, and ya..but even if I wasn't I doubt you would 
care."
	"Then let's fight.  Have you decided on a location?"
	"Yes. Me being the greatest scientist in the world I created a 
perfect spot for your battle."
	(She sounds as if this is fun!)
	(Ryoko, be strong, you have my faith.)
	(Oh, Ryoko please come back...if you leave I'll have no one to eat 
my leftovers.)
	(Ryoko, you must win. I fear if you loose Tenchi will never come 
to.)
	(Good Luck Ryoko)
	(Hey, that Nagi doesn't look too bad.)  As if everyone could hear 
Niboyuki's thought's, they all turned around and looked at him.
	"Let's go Nagi."
	"Let's" With that Nagi and Ryoko fought the belated battle between 
the bounty hunter and old criminal.  Sasami got worried and stood by 
Tenchi holding his hand.  Ryo-Ohki and Ken-Ohki cried out to the two 
warriors.  Washu and Niboyuki both had worried faces on.  Yosho just 
looked as calm as he always did.  Ayeka looked frightened but Tenchi was 
in the worst shape of all.  The inside of was screaming to get out and 
fight Nagi to end this.  Ryoko could sense it and called out to him.
	^^No Tenchi, this is my fight, I WILL come back to you, My power 
may not be the strongest but I have you.^^ She shed a single tear, and 
only Tenchi could see it.  Nagi saw this chance for an open shot and 
fired a blue beam at Ryoko.  The beam hit Ryoko on the side causing her 
to fall back a step but she remained focused and fired her energy beams 
at Nagi.  Everyone was still in shock and when Ryoko got hit they all 
seemed to be one mind, they all flinched at once.
	"Ryoko, you are weak, what ever happened to tiring me out? Hahaha"
	"Ha!  Nagi, I'm just getting started."  With that Ryoko fired 
another beam hitting Nagi in the shoulder.
	"Go Ryoko!"  Nagi, angry at the wound she just caused started 
firing beam after beam just throwing them at her.  The beams were coming 
too fast for Ryoko to phase away from them all. When she would move away 
from one another would be there.
	"AHH!"  She then put on her shield to protect her from the 
oncoming beams.
	"Getting tired?"
	"Nagi, my life before you was peaceful, I was having the life I 
always wanted.  For that you will pay forever."  She then shot 
everything she had in her.  Firing beam after beam back at Nagi.  But 
Nagi knew this would happen and put up her shield.
	"Ryoko, Ryoko, Ryoko" she tsked, "How about I make this 
interesting."  She then shot a beam right for Tenchi.
	"NOOOO!"
	"Ugh...."  The beam hit Tenchi on his right leg, causing him to 
fall in pain.
	"TENCHI!!  Now you die!!"  Ryoko ran straight for Nagi, while 
powering up her energy sword.  They began sword fighting so fast that no 
one could follow them.
	"Come on Ryoko, hit me."  Then all of a sudden Ryoko fell to the 
ground hard holding her stomach.  (I didn't think Nagi would be this 
strong.)  Even though Tenchi was in pain, he could hear her thought.
	"Nagi, that's it...now you fight me."
	"No, this is MY fight!"  Again she ran for Nagi, but this time she 
had a plan.  While she was running she still powered her sword and right 
before she jumped to attack, she phased behind Nagi, and instead of 
slicing threw her, knocked her over the head.  Because the blow was 
hard, Nagi fell to the ground unconscious.  "I can't stand killing 
another person.  Ken-Ohki takes Nagi to a clinic and keeps her safe.  
Warn her that if she returns again, I won't spare her."
	"Ryoko, you did it!"
	"Yes Sasami, and that better be the last time...ugh"  
	"RYOKO!!"  Ryoko from the last blow feel to the ground and was 
unconscious.  "RYOKO!"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	"Washu, is Ryoko going to be alright?"
	"Yes Tenchi, she should be.  But it might take a while.  This is 
the second time she has been hit bad in the side.  I'm going to go to 
bed"
	"I'm going to stay here to watch her." (Oh Ryoko, didn't I tell 
you to be careful...You have to make it!  I don't know what I would do 
with out you.  The others are also worried about you.  But I'm proud of 
you for not killing Nagi.  I'm sorry for causing you more trouble today, 
when I distracted you.  It's all my fault....) Tenchi just stayed in 
Washu's lab watching Ryoko's unconscious body until he fell in a deep 
sleep...^^^"Where am I?  Where is this??  It looks like a different 
planet...Is that Ryoko?  KAGATO!  This is in the past...why am I 
here.... NO! Ryoko stop!!  Those children are helpless.... WAKE UP!!  I 
can't stand this...Why am I here!!  It's me Tenchi...Ryoko!  Your 
eyes.... they're red...It's Kagato...NO!  It's me Tenchi!!  Don't kill 
me!! AHHHHHHHHHHH................"^^^
	"AHHH...oh...Ryoko?"  (It was a dream...but why?  She's still 
unconscious.  What she said when she knocked out Nagi...^I can't stand 
killing another person. ^  I know what she means know.... oh Ryoko.  You 
have to wake up.)
	"Tenchi, you should get something to eat."
	"Washu...I feel I have to stay here..."
	"You need to eat...everyone is worried about you."
	"Yes Miss Washu..."
	"OH Tenchi, are you okay?"
	"Yes Sasami thank you for keeping my food still."
	"Of course Tenchi."
	"Lord Tenchi, do you need anything...does Miss Ryoko need 
anything...How is she?"
	"She is still unconscious and there is no sign of recovery yet. 
Only time will tell."
	"Oh I'm so sorry Lord Tenchi!!"  She began crying uncontrollably 
in Tenchi's arms.
	"She'll be alright.  I'm going to watch her."  He left back into 
the lab.
	(Oh Tenchi, this shouldn't have happened.  Your happiness is my 
happiness.  I know Miss Ryoko will get better.  But the later she does, 
the worse Tenchi will be.  Wake up Ryoko....) The Masaki house was very 
quiets that morning, and the silence dragged on till lunch and dinner.  
At dinner Tenchi finally came out of Washu's lab again.  His face showed 
Ryoko's state was still the same.
	"Tenchi, I know Miss Ryoko will get better.  I have faith in her"
	"Yes, Ryoko isn't a quitter!"
	"Thank you Sasami and Ayeka."  But his sadness was still 
overwhelming.  He felt so sad that he couldn't feel the pain in his leg 
anymore.  That night he returned to the lab to watch Ryoko.  (Ryoko, 
please wake up.)  Before he was there for ten minutes he fell asleep.
	In the morning he woke up seeing that Ryoko wasn't in the bed. 
(Ryoko?) He began to worry when he didn't her in the bed.
	"Hey."
	"HUH? RYOKO!"  She was floating above him as she used to when he 
slept.  He glommed her and held on as if he would never let go.
	"Lighten up. I still hurt."
	"Oh!  Ryoko your okay."
	"Of course I'm fine. You didn't think I wouldn't make it now??  
But how's your leg?"
	"Oh! I forgot about it.  It doesn't hurt badly.  Ryoko promise me
