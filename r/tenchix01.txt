DISCLAIMERS!!!!

Tenchi Muyo, Universe and others are owned by pioneer and others that I
probably don't know about. Others are mine and only mine. You can use my
characters but ask first. In case you are not in it, Iâ€™m in AOL. But
what's
with this chitchat? Let's do thisÂ

Tenchi X
Episode 1: A New Enemy

                           Written by: SSGoten117

Author's Note: This is kind of like Tenchi Muyo so Tenchi can summon the
Lighthawk Wings and do that transformation thing. Nagi is also in this. One
more thing: Ryoko can still summon demons

*It starts with Tenchi walking back to the house after a day of doing
chores*

Tenchi: Whew! I am so tired. I need to rest *He opens thedoor*

*Inside is Ryoko who seemed to be waiting for him, Ayeka whois watching a TV

that isn't Tenchiâ€™s and Washu who was doing nothing. Sasami could be heard
in
the kitchen*

Tenchi: Don't you have anything else to do, Ryoko?

Ryoko: Teenchiiiiii! *She hugs him* I thought a car hit you!

Tenchi: What makes you think that?

*Ayeka pushes Ryoko away*

Ayeka: I thought you were just fine

Tenchi: uuuuhhhhâ€¦

Washu: Hey! Look at the news!

*Ayeka, Ryoko and Susami look at the television*

News Reporter: In other news, Chicatchi, Juraian leader, died today. His
will
was found and said of a child that he had. No written records said of any
child that Chicatchi had. Juraian search crews are searching every planet to

look for the child because it says on the will that the child will take his
place in rank.

Ayeka: Chicatchi was my uncleâ€¦

Tenchi: Really?

Ayeka: Yes, he was

Susami: We should go to the funeral

Ayeka: I agree

Ryoko: Good, you two go and Ill stay with Tenchiâ€¦

Tenchi: We'll come with you

Ryoko: Hey!

Ayeka: Okay

Ryoko: Isn't anyone listening?

Washu: Ill come too

Ryoko: HELLO?!

Tenchi: Then it's all settled! Hold on, Ryoko, are you coming?

Ryoko: HE-Yeah â€¦ okay, I guessâ€¦

== The Next Day ==

*Tenchi, Ryoko and Washu leave in Ryo- Ohki and Susami, Ayeka, Mihoshi and
Kiyone leave in Ugami*

Ryoko: Erâ€¦ what's going to happen when we get to Jurai?

Tenchi: What do you mean?

Ryoko: Hello? Iâ€™m a space pirate!

Washu: Oh, Ill handle that

*Washu uses her holotop to give Ryoko and Ryo- Ohki adisguise*

Ayeka: I wonder who that mysterious child was

Mihoshi: *All of a sudden in a Sherlock Holmes outfit* This sounds like a
mystery my dear Watson

Ayeka and Kiyone: *Punching Mihoshi on the head* NOT THAT AGAIN!!!

*All of a sudden, a blast hits Ugami and Ryo- Ohki*

Everyone: WHAT WAS THAT?

Ryoko and Kiyone (at the same time): Bring up screen!

*The screens go up to reveal a huge, blue spaceship*

Mihoshi: *Starts singing Blue by Eiffel 65* I'm blue Iâ€™m in need of a guy,
Da
Ba Dee Da Ba Die, If I was green I would dieâ€¦

Ayeka: SHUT UP!!! SOMEONE'S FIRING AT US!!!

*Mihoshi runs away, crying*

Susami: That wasn't very nice

Ayeka: I DON'T CARE!!! SOMEONE'S FIRING AT US!!!!

Kiyone: Oy, veyâ€¦

*Another screen appears and a man is on it*

Man: Hahahahaha!!!

Ayeka: What's so funny?

Man: You have picked the wrong time out of the 24 hours, outof the 60
minutes, out of the 60 seconds even to be seen by Kagato, the universe's
most
powerful space pirate!!! I will now destroy you both!!!

*Ryo- Ohki got the same transmission*

Tenchi: Uh-oh

*A beam fires out which sends the two ships spiraling towards the planet
below them*

Mihoshi: We're going toâ€¦

Kiyone: â€¦ crashâ€¦

Ayeka: â€¦ and burn

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  To Be Continuedâ€¦

As I said before, Tenchi Muyo and Universe characters are made and/or owned
by pioneer. But I don't know much so don't listen to me much or you'll
regret
it!
