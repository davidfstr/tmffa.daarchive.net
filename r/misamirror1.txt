Misa

Part 1

Into the past...

==========

Prelude

        "30 seconds to time jump!"  shouts Washu, as red lights glare all over
the lab.

        As the lab explodes, the blue-haired princess knows that this is a
one-way trip.  "I hate this part!" shouts Sasami.

        Ryo-Ohki gives a concerned "meow!" as she and her friend disappear.

==========

        On a warm summer day, everyone is enjoying the great weather.  Sasami
is lying on an innertube, with Ryo-Ohki on her stomach.  Ryoko is
tanning on the beach.  Ayeka is lying on an inflatable raft.  Washu,
sitting near Tenchi and Ryoko on the beach, is hoping the peace will
last.

        Nothing could break the peace at the moment, having the Juraians
floating in lake.  That is until...

        Azaka appears next to the floating princesses.  "Princess Ayeka," it
addresses, "you have a message from planet Jurai."

        <There goes my day.>  "Fine, play it."

        "Princess Ayeka," a voice announces, "we need you on Jurai as soon as
possible."  The message gives Ayeka all the information she needs at the
moment.

        "Well, I guess we should go, then.  Sasami?"  she says, getting her
sister's attention.

        Looking toward her, "yes, Ayeka?"

        "We have to go to Jurai."

        "What?  Why?"

        "Obviously, those people we left in charge can't handle the situation."

        "I told you not to trust them."  Sighing, "okay, let's get this over
with."

        The two then make their way to shore.  Ayeka walks up to Ryoko, who is
trying to ignore the pair.

        "Ryoko!" she shouts, "I need you to take us to Jurai."

        "Will you be staying there?"

        Giving the freedom fighter a swift kick, she answers Ryoko's question.

        "Let's go, Tenchi," Sasami says.  "You know how Ayeka gets when you're
not around."

        "I can't go," Tenchi responds.

        "WHAT?" the Juraians shout.

        "School will be in session soon, so I can't take a trip into space."

        "Fine," Ayeka states.  "I'll see you when I get back, then."

        "I'm going with," Washu says.  "Someone's gotta make sure that Ayeka
and Sasami make it there."

        "Are you implying that I would..." Ryoko sarcastically says.

        "I would."

==========

        An hour later, the Juraians, Ryoko, and Washu are ready to go.

        "I'll see you when you get back," Tenchi says.

        "Oh, you will..." Ayeka responds.

        "I'm dead..." Tenchi says at the thought of their return.

        Ryoko shouts, "Ryo-Ohki!"

        "Meow!"  The cabbit leaps into the air and transforms into her cruiser
form.  Teleporting everyone up, she takes off.

        As Tenchi watches Ryo-Ohki fly off into the distance, sighs in relief.
"THEY'RE GONE!" he shouts happily.

        As he turns to go to the house, he sees a tall girl in his path.  She
is about as tall as him, with long sky-blue hair and deep red eyes.  She
is wearing a darker blue kimono with light blue trim and a pink sash.
She seems familiar, but Tenchi can't say where from.

        Seeing her, Tenchi walks over to her.  "I haven't seen you around here
before.  Have you come to pay respects to the shrine?"

        She shakes her head.  "I'm Misa.  My ship crashed on Earth.  My sensors
picked up  Juraian life forms nearby, so I thought it was safe to come
here.  I'm also from Jurai."

        "Oh, really?"  <Not another one!  Please, someone send her home!>  "So,
Misa, how long do you plan on staying?"

        "I don't know.  Any idea how I can get home?"

        "Well, when Ryo-Ohki gets back with Sasami and Ayeka, Ryoko can send
you home."

        "Princesses Sasami and Ayeka?  From Jurai?  And Ryoko the freedom
fighter?"

        "That's right.  Once you get to know them, you'll understand.  I'll
tell you the rest on the way to the house."  On the way to the house,
Tenchi tells Misa about Mihoshi, Kiyone, Washu, and the rest.

        Tenchi finishes, "and only a couple of months ago, everyone showed up
again.  Even Ryoko.  She really is tough.  I was just glad to see that
she wasn't as seriously injured as I thought."

        "And then you went into the past?  Right?"

        "Misa, how did you know that?"

        Blushing, "I'll tell you later."  Walking into the house, "I could use
a bath.  Do you mind?"

        "No, go ahead.  When you're done, I want to know more about you."

        "All right."

        Tenchi shows her to the bath, and then trots upstairs to his room.
"How in the world did she know about the trip into the past?"

==========

        In the huge bath, Misa finally says, "ok, the coast is clear."

        From Misa's feet, a small cabbit crawls out.  Sweating heavily, she
lets off an exhausted "meow."  The little creature takes off towards a
smaller pool, especially made for cabbits.

        Stepping behind a screen, "if I had to act sweet for one more second,
the results wouldn't be pretty."  She disrobes and wraps a towel around
her body.  Wading into the pool, "well, Ryo-Ohki, we made it this far.
Now, you need to stay out of sight for awhile."

        Dropping its perched ears, she let's off a whiny "meow."

        "Quit your whining.  If this time's Ryo-Ohki found you, do you know
what would happen?"

        Ryo-Ohki looks down, sighing.

        "Fine.  I'll bring carrots for you.  Does that make you happy?"



        "Meow!"

==========

        After a long bath, Misa walks up to Tenchi's room.  Wearing only a
towel, she closes the door behind her.

        Looking as red as possible, "Misa, what is it?"



        "Tenchi, my name isn't Misa."  She brushes her first two right fingers
across her forehead to reveal two circles.  Doing then does the same
with her left against her closed eyes to reveal a pink color to them.

        <Oh, no!  It can't be!>  "Who are you?"

        Looking frustrated, she grabs her long hair with both hands and pulls
it into two pony-tails.  "Now, do you know who I am?"

        "Sasami?"

        "About time you figured it out.  I thought you'd recognize me right
away."

        "It's just that you look a lot older than last time I saw you."

        "Well, genius, don't you think Washu had something to do with that?"

        <She's worse than before!>  "So, what are you doing here?"

        "Ten years from now, Earth will be destroyed.  We didn't know until it
was too late.  I was sent to the past to warn you.  I was only supposed
to only go one month back, but the lab was destroyed during my jump,
which randomized the place and time of my destination.  So, I'm stuck
here.  Permanently."

        <Oh, no!  Not another one!>  "So, it's just you?"

        Suddenly, there is a loud THUMP on the door, just before Ryo-Ohki
passes through it.

        "You brought Ryo-Ohki?"  <I should have known.>  "Don't let anyone else
find out about her, especially this time's Ryo-Ohki."

        "I already told her to stay in the bath," looking at Ryo-Ohki, "didn't
I?"

        The cabbit puts up a defensive paw and gives off a short whiny "miya."

        "So, Sasami, I guess everyone else will call you Misa, right?"

        "Right.  Nobody else should know."

        "So, why tell me?"

        "I need to have a little fun while I'm in the past.  You've always
found a way to help me with that."

        "Oh, no.  You don't mean..."

        "Misa smiles.  I'm starting to feel a little bored."  Dropping her
towel on Ryo-Ohki, "after all, Tenchi, I'm a woman with needs."

-End part one!-
