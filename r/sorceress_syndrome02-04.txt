***********************************************************************

Hi everyone!  Ooh, the plot is thickening.  Dr. Hadenka wants Nekaia.  
Tenchi is getting sicker.  And Ryoko and Aeka are fighting.  A lot.  As 
you should know by now, I don't own Tenchi Muyo!  I only own Keimosari 
and Nekaia.  But if you wanna use them in a fan fic, go ahead.  I just 
want to read it!  Okay, then, I'll let you read now.
-The SoJ
P.S.  Don't get mad if I don't write for a while.  I have to do this 
project for school.  I have to prove aliens exist.  And they do, cuz I 
mean, what's Aeka, and Sasami, and Washu, and Ryoko, and Mihoshi, and 
Kiyone if aliens don't exist?

	"Stop it!  Leave me alone!  What do you want with me?" Nekaia 
screamed.  Dr. Hadenka just stepped closer.
	"You are overreacting.  I do not wish to harm you in any way, if 
I even could.  I am merely asking you kindly for your help," he replied 
gently.
	"Kindly.  Right.  Just get away from me.  I absolutely refuse to 
help you or hurt Keimosari," Nekaia scowled.
	"Why do you wish to defend the Sorceress of Jurai?  You know 
nothing about her, and she knows nothing about you," Hadenka asked.
	"I know that Keimosari is the sweetest girl I ever met.  She 
treats me so kindly, and promised to help me.  And as for her not 
knowing anything about me, well, I don't even know anything about me," 
Nekaia snapped.
	"Ahh, but I do.  And I would be more than willing to share that 
information with you if you would just assist me in getting Keimosari's 
stones," Hadenka smiled.
	"No!  You're lying!  You are a sick, sick man.  I will not do 
anything to help you, got it?  Nothing!" yelled Nekaia.  All of a 
sudden, the image of Dr. Hadenka disappeared.
	"Nekaia?  Nekaia what are you doing in my room?" asked a voice.  
Nekaia turned around.  She was in Keimosari's room, bent over her bed.
	"Niki-chan, what's wrong?  Were you sleepwalking?" Keimosari 
asked, sitting up.  Nekaia just shook her head.
	"I guess, I just had a bad dream," she answered.
	"Do you want to talk about it?" asked Keimosari.
	"No thanks.  Sorry I woke you up.  I'll go back to sleep," Nekaia 
shuffled out of the room.  Keimosari stared after her.  There was 
something wrong with her friend, she just couldn't figure out what.
***********************************************************************
***************
	The next morning, Washu called everyone into her lab.  She showed 
them a map of the Pacific Ocean, not far from Hawaii.
	"Let me guess, next stone?" asked Tenchi.  Washu nodded.
	"But I don't know what.  There's no unfamiliar forms of energy 
coming from there, but the energy readings are off the scale.  That's 
definitely the sign of a power stone."
	"Well, do we know where we have to go?" asked Nekaia.  
	"The source is pinpointed off the coast of Hawaii.  I figure it 
would be best to fly into Honolulu, then we can rent a boat and go into 
the out on the ocean to look for the monster.
	"And this time, Tenchi, you're not coming!" Keimosari said 
firmly.  Tenchi saw the fear in her eyes.  He couldn't remember what 
happened at the nightclub after he saw Kiyone be floated up to the 
second story.  He must have slipped into unconsciousness, because he 
woke up a few days later in Washu's lab.  But Keimosari and Kiyone told 
him the whole story, about how the monster had tried to strangle him, 
and how the strange bullet had caused another attack.
	"But what I don't understand is, how did the bullet get there?"  
Tenchi asked.  Nekaia closed her eyes.  She remembered something about 
holding a gun.  Was she?
	"Tenchi?"  she asked quietly.  Tenchi turned to her.
	"Yeah?"
	Nekaia shook her head.  She had forgotten everything.  Ryoko put 
her arm around Tenchi.
	"Don't worry!  I get seasick.  I'll stay at a hotel with you 
while the others go out to find the monster," she said.  Tenchi shook 
his head.
	"No way Ryoko!  You think I'm going to let you stay with Tenchi, 
alone, at a hotel?"  Aeka screamed.
	"Come on guys.  You can both stay with Tenchi," Keimosari 
offered.  Tenchi glared at her.
	"Thank you so much, dear, sweet sister of mine," he replied 
sarcastically.  Keimosari smiled and patted his back.
	"You're ever so welcome," she grinned, before bounding out the 
door to pack.
***********************************************************************
*
	"Oh my God, Niki-chan, how the h*** are we gonna afford this?" 
Kiyone screamed, looking at the hotel.  Of all the places they had 
stayed, this was definitely the most expensive, because they were 
staying in a private beachhouse.  Well not exactly a beach house.
	"Look you guys, the Mansion only costs $9,000 per night.  I 
figure, Tenchi, Aeka, and Ryoko can work it all off while the rest of 
us are stone-hunting," Nekaia answered calmly.
	"You mean, you're endless supply of cash is drying up?" Ryoko 
asked.  Nekaia turned red and laughed nervously.
	"Um, it's funny you should ask that.  As a matter of fact, uh, 
well, yes," Nekaia finished off the last word quickly.
	"WHAT?" cried everyone else.  Nekaia's face grew an even brighter 
red.
	"Well, um, you never know how much the Millionaire's Edition of 
Monopoly will cost you.  In this case, it was approximately ten million 
dollars," she explained.  The others groaned.
	"But don't worry.  I have enough money left to last us two days 
here.  Then, um, we're broke," she answered.
	"So we have to find the stone in two days?" Keimosari exclaimed.  
This was going to be tough.  Very tough.
***********************************************************************
*
	"Ahh, this is the life, huh Aeka?" Ryoko asked.  She and Aeka 
were lounging in the private pool at the mansion while the others were 
gone hunting for the new stone.  But Aeka was fretful.
	"I don't know.  Where's Tenchi?  I mean, he was supposed to come 
back from work an hour ago," she replied worriedly.  Ryoko just 
stretched out her arms and yawned.
	"He's probably working overtime.  I mean, we've only got $9,000 
left.  And since you refuse to work, we're gonna have problems paying 
for bills," Ryoko said.
	"I refuse to work?  Look who's talking.  I suppose working on 
your tan is considered volunteer work?" Aeka accused.
	"Hey, at least I can get a tan.  You're as white as a tub of 
lard.  And you look like one too," Ryoko teased.
	"Okay, that's the last straw.  Azaka!  Kamidake!" 
	The two logs appeared next to Aeka, ready to fight.  Ryoko 
smiled, and attacked.
***********************************************************************
*
	Little did the two girls know, Tenchi was in the mansion at the 
very moment, resting.  This time, he couldn't even go into 
unconsciousness.  He was awake, and felt the pain.
	But the strangest thing was an odd vision he had.  Two women, 
both tall and beautiful, were consorting with a tall man working at a 
computer.  The man looked exactly like Dr. Hadenka.  But the women were 
unfamiliar.
	The first had long blond hair, and aqua-gray eyes.  She sort of 
looked like an older version of Nekaia.  She was wearing a long gold 
dress, and a crown set with a large topaz.  The second woman had dark, 
dark skin.  Her eyes and hair were black as well, along with her dress.  
	Another convulsion of pain twisted through Tenchi, and he 
collapsed on the floor, calling out his sister's name.
***********************************************************************
*
	"Guys, I'm hungry," Mihoshi complained.  The others groaned.
	"Mihoshi, if you eat anymore, we're gonna run out of food!  We're 
supposed to be back in two days, we need to ration!" Washu said.
	"Whoa, those are some huge waves," Keimosari acknowledged.  
Nekaia smiled and stood next to her.
	"Ever try surfing Kei?" she asked.  Keimosari shook her head.
	"There were no large bodies of water near the Palace of the 
Sorceress.  I never learned how to swim.  And frankly, I don't want 
to," she answered, taking a step back from the edge of the boat.
	"Washu?  What's this thing?" Kiyone asked.  She pointed to a 
meter attached to Washu's laptop.
	"It's a device that measures how much power is being radiated off 
of unnatural things.  The level's been increasing for the last hour 
now, so I think we're getting close," Washu answered, then grinned at 
Keimosari.  "Better get that bracelet ready for some Sorceress action."
	"But, what would be out here?  There's no irregular power 
reading--"  Keimosari was cut off.  A huge wave had crashed over the 
side of the small boat, pulling both her and Nekaia overboard.
	"KEI!" everyone screamed.  The Sorceress struggled to keep her 
head above the salty water.
	"Guys!  I can't swim!" she called desperately.  Suddenly, she 
felt herself being lifted upwards.
	"Don't worry Kei, I've got you!" Nekaia called.  But it wasn't 
her that was pulling them upwards.  A huge wave had lifted them up, and 
was slowly changing shape.  Washu glanced at her computer.
	"Oh my God, I'm such an idiot.  The Water Stone!"  she cried.  
Mihoshi and Kiyone began firing at the wave, but it was no use.
	"Kei, why isn't it disappearing?  You're touching it!" Nekaia 
yelled.
	"The Water Stone doesn't have a fixed physical shape!  I can't 
contain it!" Keimosari screamed, but she was pulled under.  Almost 
right after, the boat holding Mihoshi, Washu, Kiyone, and Sasami tipped 
over.  Nekaia was alone now.
	"Leave my friends ALONE!" she bellowed.  Amazingly, she began to 
glow.  A gold circle appeared around her and grew until it surrounded 
her friends.  The water couldn't penetrate the circle, so it was backed 
away.  There was a deafening roar, and a blast of light as Nekaia 
looked up.  The huge waves disappeared, and the ocean was calm.  A 
small blue stone appeared on Keimosari's bracelet.  Nekaia sighed, and 
the circle collapsed.
***********************************************************************

	"Ha.  I win!" Aeka gloated.  She had managed to push Ryoko in the 
pool, then Azaka and Kamidake followed with an electrical attack.  
Ryoko was now black and very crispy.
	"Yeah, yeah.  I'm going back in the house," she grumbled, but 
screamed when she opened the door.
	"What is it, a mirror?" Aeka teased, but gasped when she looked 
inside.  Littering the floor of the luxurious house, were the bodies of 
their friends.
	"TENCHI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Aeka and Ryoko screamed in 
unison, finding him under the lifeless body of Keimosari.  He was 
unconscious, but sweating fiercely, a sign he was alive.
	"Do something Ryoko!  Revive him!" Aeka cried in a panic.  Ryoko 
looked at her with calm eyes and slapped her.
	"Get a grip princess!  Then, get Tenchi some water.  We'll figure 
out the others when we get Tenchi awake," she said.  Aeka dashed off 
for the kitchen.  When she returned with a cup of water, Ryoko gently 
parted Tenchi's lips and poured the water down his throat.  He 
sputtered and opened his eyes.
	"Ryoko?  Aeka?  Whoa, what the," he trailed off, looking at the 
floor.
	"What happened?" he asked.  Aeka shrugged.
	"We found them here after we were hanging out in the pool.  You 
were with them," she answered.  Tenchi ran to the phone.
	"Hello?  I need an ambulance over here quick!" he said, a tone of 
fear in his voice.
