Tenchi Muyo Follow your heart

Chapter 4.

        As the sun crests over the eastern horizon, the house
is busy with movement as
everyone prepares for Tenchi and Ayeka's wedding.
Lady Misaki, Sasami, and Mihoshi
are in the kitchen preparing a light breakfast and
several dishes for the reception.
Upstairs, Lady Funaho is helping Ayeka keep calm while
getting her Uchikake and
Kimonos ready.  While at the temple Yosho, Nobayuki,
and Tenchi try to prepare the
Shrine for the ceremony ahead.  But both Yosho and
Tenchi are trying to calm down
Nobayuki whenever he begins to cry and hug his son.
While babbling, "Oh glory days
are here my dear departed wife in heaven.  Our son is
to be married today and soon
we shall be graced with the pitter patter of little
feet."
"Grandpa, have you heard any word from Washu about
Ryoko?"
"I have not seen her since yesterday.  My guess is
that she is still trying to locate
Ryoko.  Don't worry, she promised to inform us the
instant she found her."
"I guess your right."

**************************************************************

        Back at the house, Ryo-Ohki phases through Tenchi's
window in the hopes of
finding him.  After miyaing a couple of times, Sasami
hears her as she is walking
down the hall.  Going into Tenchi's room, Sasami finds
the cabbit crying in the
middle of the room.
"Ryo-Ohki, where have you been?  I've been so worried
about you."
Pointing at Tenchi's bed, she begins to miya several
times.
"Are you looking for Tenchi."
"Miya."
"He is at the shrine getting ready for the wedding.
Come on both you and I need to
get dressed up as well.  We are the ones who get to
lead the procession."
"Miya."
"No, you need to change into your humanoid form
in-order to fit into the dress mom
got for you.  By the way, have you seen Ryoko?"
"Miya, miya, miya, miya, miya."
"Good, Tenchi's been worried about her.  Now you can
take him to where ever she is.
But you have to remember that only Washu and Ryoko can
understand what you are
saying.  So you are going to have to guide us to her
location."
Miyaing as she puts one of her paws to her forehead,
Ryo-Ohki falls back and is
picked up Sasami as she giggles seeing her reaction.

************************ Washu's Lab
**************************

'Ryo-Ohki what is taking so long?  Have you been able
to find Tenchi?'
'Miya, miya, miya, miya.'
'What do you mean your getting ready for his wedding.
Also, what do you mean by
getting your hair fixed.'
'Miya, miya, miya.'
'Fine get dressed, but remember you must tell him
about Ryoko's predicament.'
'Miya.'
'I've been thinking about that and there is a probable
chance that you might be
able too talk to him.  But in order for my theory to
work, he has to have
Tenchi-ken within his possession.  You see, it will be
the gems imbedded in the
hilt of Tenchi-ken that will be used to establish a
temporary link for both of
you.  But in-order for the link to be activated, both
of you need to be thinking
about Ryoko.'
'Miya, miya, miya.'
'Don't worry about me.  I'm creating a new
inter-dimensional door, which I can
use to provide me access to any place I desire.  Of
course, since it is still in
its development stage it has a limited range.  But
rest assure, I will deal with
that problem in due time.'
'Miya.'
'By the way, where is the ceremony taking place?'
'Miya, miya.'
'Alright, I will be there once this is completed.  I
just hope I won't be late
for anything important.'

*****************************************************************

        As the time for the ceremony approaches, the families
begin to gather at
the Shrine.  Nobayuki is still in tears and saying a
couple of incoherent words.
Tenchi is standing next to his grandfather and trying
not to pass out.  Both
Ladies Misaki and Funaho are helping Ayeka with her
Uchikake.  Well, it's more
like Lady Funaho is helping Ayeka with the touch-ups
while Sasami and Ryo-Ohki
are comforting Lady Misaki.  And Emperor Azusa is
talking to several members of
the council about Tenchi's training and loyal
obedience to him and the Jurain
Empire.
        After a couple of moments of waiting, the ceremony
was underway.  Tenchi
stood next to his father as the procession began to
make it's way into the
Shrine.  The first ones to enter were both Sasami and
Ryo-Ohki.  Ryo-Ohki was
carrying a basket of flowers as she sprinkled some
petals on the aisle.  Next
to her Sasami was doing the part of the 'Miko', by
bringing the three stacked
saki cups.  Preceding them were Ladies Funaho and
Misaki.  When each one of
them took their places, all eyes turned to the
entrance as Ayeka and Emperor
Azusa walked in.  While they slowly moved down the
aisle, Tenchi's nervousness
overwhelmed him causing him to blank out.  But he was
brought back from his
dream state when Azusa presented Ayeka next to him.
When all the guests took
their seats, Yosho began to perform the purification
ceremony.  Once the
ceremony began, Ryo-Ohki began to think of Ryoko in
the hopes of communicating
with Tenchi.  And at the same time, Tenchi began to
recount the events which
lead up to this very moment in his life.  The first
things that kept repeating
in his mind were the deal of Ryoko's safety and the
announcement concerning
the marriage given by the Emperor.  Then images of
Ryoko crying as she ran out
of the house kept reappearing like a scratched record.
'Miya.' <Tenchi.>
<W...What's going on?>
'Miya, miya, miya, miya.' <Tenchi, its me Ryo-Ohki.
Can you hear me?>
<I can't believe this; I'm starting to hear voices in
my head.>
Contemplating the thought of actually talking with
Ryo-Ohki, he turns around
to face her.  Ryo-Ohki for her part smiles at him and
says, "Miya".
<Hi Tenchi!>
<R...Ryo..Ryo-Ohki.  How is this possible?>
        As Tenchi is looking at the cabbit, Emperor Azusa
wonders what is it
about the cabbit that has got a hold of the boy's
attention.  Not taking any
chances he slowly makes his way towards Sasami and
Ryo-Ohki.
'Miya, miya, miya, miya, miya.' <According to Washu,
we are using Tenchi-ken
as a link to communicate with one another.>
<Ryo-Ohki, do you know where Ryoko is?>
'Miya, miya, miya.' <I can show you where she is and
how she got there.>
        Going into a trance like state, Tenchi leans forward
a bit and begins
to see images of Ryoko.  He goes through several
emotions while viewing
Ryoko's situation.  At first, the sight of her crying
as she ran away from
the house and the minutes she spent by Funaho caused
him to shed a few tears
of his own knowing that he had caused her such pain.
Next was a mixture of
shock and mistrust as he viewed Ayeka's effort of
battle against her when she
politely refused and asked to be left alone.  Then as
Ryoko was captured and
taken to the Emperors ship his emotions went from
mistrust to rage.  As the
last image began to fade away, he is asked by Yosho to
read his oath of
faithfulness and obedience to Ayeka, as she will do
the same after he finishes.
To Ayeka's surprise and those attending the ceremony,
Tenchi stood up and
turned around.
"Azusa, you lied to me in your promise not to harm
Ryoko!"
<How could the boy know of her situation?  No one
could have leaked the
information.  Unless...> Turning toward the cabbit,
Azusa pulls out his sword
and charges at Ryo-Ohki.  Yelling, "It was you!"
        Activating Tenchi-ken and jumping in front of
Ryo-Ohki, Tenchi barely
manages to block Azusa's strike.  Scared, Ryo-Ohki
turns around and hugs
Sasami.  While next to Yosho a bright red light
flashed, obscuring everyone's
vision.  Stepping out through her new portal, Washu
says, "Hello everyone, I
hope I'm not late".  Seeing a way to safety, Ryo-Ohki
runs past Washu and into
the portal.  Observing the scene in front of her,
Washu is bumped by Sasami
towards Yosho as she follows Ryo-Ohki inside.
"Washu are you all right?"
"Thank you Yosho.  Yes, I am fine but what is going
on."
"My father was trying to attack Ryo-Ohki since Tenchi
stopped the wedding."
"Wait until he finds out that Tenchi is going after
Ryoko.  Well, we have to
go now and make preparations for a rescue.  Tenchi
lets go!"
"Right behind you."
"Well folks, it really was a beautiful ceremony but we
have to go now."
Voiced Washu as she waved to everyone as the portal
closed.
"What the hell happened just right now?"  Asked a
surprised Lady Misaki.
"Azaka, Kamadake!"  Shouted the Emperor.
"Father, how did he find out?"
Once the guardians appeared, Azusa turned toward them.
"How was she able to leave her lab?  Did I not give
you two specific
instructions to keep her locked up?  Now the boy knows
about Ryoko and is
gone with Washu.  I want you to go inside that lab of
hers and apprehend Washu,
Tenchi, and that Ryo-Ohki!"
"Your majesty, not one of us can go inside Professor
Washu's lab without her
permission."
"What!?"
"In order to gain access to the lab, Professor Washu
must grant you access."
"Well then, I want you two to find a way into that
place.  Now!!!"
"Yes sir."
"Azusa, what did Tenchi mean when he referred to you
harming Ryoko?"  Asked
Lady Misaki.
"Not now Misaki."
"I believe we have time for an answer to my sisters
question, husband."  Replied
Lady Funaho as she slowly approached the Emperor.

************************** Washu's Lab
*******************************

"Ryo-Ohki, are you ok?"  Asked Sasami as she picked up
the cabbit.
"Tenchi, how much did Ryo-Ohki tell you of Ryoko's
situation."
"I was able to see the situation as it happened and
what he plans to do to her.
So mother Washu, how do we go about as to saving her."
"Well, since Ryo-Ohki is the only ship we have
available next to Mihoshi's
Yukinojo.  We need to make preparations for any
possible defenses laid out by
the Jurian's."
"Shouldn't we ask Mihoshi for help in case my fathers
ship attacks Ryo-Ohki."
"Sasami, there is a probable chance that the galaxy
police might be assisting
the Emperor in the transportation of Ryoko.  And if
that is the case, Mihoshi
will be called upon to stop us."
"Mother Washu.  If we are going to battle both of
these forces, what are our
chances of success?"
"If you were to access the light hawk wings, this
mission would be simple.  But
since you haven't been able to activate them, since
the incident with Dr. Clay,
our chances are not that good."
"Tell me Washu, what can we do."
"I have a theory which might work if I were to acquire
the assistance of a
certain individual."
"Who?"
Knowing whom Washu was talking about, Sasami allowed
Tsunami to link with her
in order to help out.
"Well, I need Tsunami's help to accomplish what I have
in mind."
"Tsunami."
"Yes little Washu, how is it that I may assist you?"
Asked Tsunami.
"I need you help in providing Tenchi with a copy of
one of Ryoko's gems.  By
providing him with such a gem he will be able to gain
some of the abilities
which Ryoko possesses."
"But won't this provide both of them the ability to
have access to each others
memories?"
"Yes, but they will also be able to communicate with
each other through a mind
link just as Ryoko, Ryo-Ohki, and I communicate with
one another."
"Excuse me Mother Washu."
"Yes Tenchi."
"Concerning Ryoko's memories, how...how"
"You will be able to see, feel, and hear everything
she has ever experienced.
Don't worry, all the information will be down loaded
into your gem in an instant.
Although you will experience some loss of motor
functions due to the shock of
accepting so much information all at once.  But it
should only be for a couple of
seconds.  There is something I must tell you about the
information you will have
access too.  There will be certain time frames in
Ryoko's life that you will need
her permission to view those particular events.  Also,
any experiences she had
after you gave her the gem will not be available until
both of you make contact
with each others gem."
"What about Ryoko, will she be experiencing the same
thing as me?"
"Yes, but it will be until you are able to make
contact with both her and your
gem.  And just like you, she will need your permission
to view certain things.
I have set this particular time frame, starting from
the time you gave her one
of her gem back until the time you received your gem."
"Well then if this is going to help me rescue her,
when do we start."

*********************************************************************

Meanwhile orbiting around Saturn, the Juarian ships
make their transfer.
"Captain Lye, the prisoner is now in your custody.
She tried to escape once
when we started our journey.  But no further attempts
were made after we were
able to knock her unconscious."
"Thank you Captain Gateaux, we shall proceed to Jurai
as per the Emperors
request.  If all goes well, we should arrive where
within four Earth days."
"Splendid, I shall inform the Emperor of your travel
time and inquire if
procedures to eliminate her are to begin immediately
or until his arrival."

***********************************************************************

        After a few hours of preparation both Tsunami and
Washu were ready to
begin the gem transfer.  Tenchi held on to Tenchi-ken
and remembered the
time he gave Ryoko back one of her own gems.  Now here
he was about to receive
a similar gem created by Washu with the help of
Tsunami.  As the transfer
process was being done, Ryo-Ohki viewed the situation
developing at the Shrine
through one of Washu's monitors.  Emperor Azusa was
finishing his tale of how
Ryoko tried to kill Ayeka, when a bright flash
engulfed the entire lab.  After
several minutes had passed she began to squint her
eyes in order to see whom
or what it was that was moving toward her.
'Hello Ryo-Ohki.'
'Miyaaa.' <T...Tenchi.>
"Yes."  Replied Tenchi as he flew above her holding
what appeared to be an
energy ball in his left hand.
"What do you think Ryo-Ohki, is this great or what?"
'Miya, miya, miya, miya.' <You look like Ryoko the
first time she played with
her powers.>
Tenchi could only laugh as he flew through the lab
enjoying his new abilities.
"My guess is that our work was successful don't you
think, Little Washu?"
"With both the Greatest Scientific Genius in the
Galaxy and the Goddess of
Jurai on the job, how could we go wrong."
"That's true."
"Tsunami, I thought we were going to place the gem on
his right wrist?"
"We did."
"Well if you take a look, it is on his left wrist at
the moment."
"How is that possible little Washu?"
"My guess is that Tenchi had something to do with
that."
"Excuse us Tenchi, but by any chance did you wish the
gem to be placed on your
left wrist?"
Landing in front of them he replies, "Yes I did.  I
hope it is not a problem."
"Not really but why did you want it there if you don't
mind us asking."
"Well, since I gave Ryoko one of her gems on her left
wrist, I thought it would
be proper for me to receive mine there as well.  Also,
I remember the tales of
how there is a red string attached to one of the
fingers on the left hand
linking two people who are love with one another.  In
a way, I like to think of
this as our red string.  Besides, she would always say
that we were meant to be
together."
'Miya, miya, miya, miya, miya.' <I always thought she
would say that to make
Ayeka jealous.>
"Yes she did. But when she would say it, she always
meant it from the heart."
'Miya, miya, miya.' <What else do you know about her?>
"From her memories, I can see myself as a baby waving
to her the first time I
was taken to the cave.  Plus, I can feel the joy she
felt every time I would go
and play there.  And then there is the day when I was
crying."
'Miya.'  <I know.>
"Tenchi, we know that was a sad time in your life and
she was there for you.
But you must get your self together in order for you
to be there for her."  Stated
Washu.
"Mother Washu, Tsunami how do you recommend we go
about as to saving Ryoko?"
"First of all Tenchi, you and Ryo-Ohki must intercept
the Emperors ship before
they leave the sol system.  Now using your new title
within the Jurian Empire,
you should have no trouble getting onto the ship.  And
if luck is on our side,
you might be able to walk to her cell and open the
door with no problems.  But
if I am wrong, you will have to fight your way to her
cell and use Ryo-Ohki's
help to free her.  Meanwhile, Sasami and I will stay
behind and inform the
families of your departure."
"What if..."
"I'll block all communications so the Emperor can not
alert his ship of your
intentions."
"How long will their communications be blocked?"
"I can block them indefinitely.  But don't worry, we
will still be able to
communicate through our mind links."
"Great, when do we take off?"
Handing him a small black cube Washu replies, "In a
moment, here you might need
this."
"What is it Mother Washu?"
"It's a present for the Emperors ship and crew.  Don't
worry you'll know when to
use it."

*****************************************************************************

        Finishing telling his version of the incident in
question, the Emperor along
with everyone at the Shrine walked back to the house.
As they reached the lake
the same red flash they had seen at the Shrine
appeared at the dock.  When the
door was opened out stepped Tenchi, Washu, and Sasami
with Ryo-Ohki on top of
her head.
"Well Mother Washu, Sasami we'll be back soon once we
rescue Ryoko."
"Good luck Tenchi and do me a favor.  Give Ryoko a hug
for me when you are both
safe and coming back."  Stated Sasami as she hugged
him.
"I'll give you two as much help as I can from over
here so don't worry.  Just come
back safe and in one piece, both of you."
Seeing Washu and Tenchi, Emperor Azusa calls the
guardians into action.
"Azaka, Kamadake arrest them at once!"
Appearing next to Washu, the guardians are placed in a
forcefield as they hover above
the dock.
"Azaka, Kamadake what are you doing over here?"  Asked
Sasami.
"We were sent by your father on orders to arrest all
of you.  But we seem to be in a
predicament at the moment."  Voiced both of them in
unison.
"I thought he might try something like this so I made
some preparations just to be
sure.  I hope you two are not uncomfortable in there?"
"No Professor Washu, it is quite roomy in here but we
do ask that you let us out."
"Once Tenchi and Ryo-Ohki have departed, I'll release
you two.  Now Tenchi go
before we get any more delays."
"On our way.  Ryo-Ohki lets go."  Replied Tenchi as he
threw the cabbit in the air
so it could transform.
As Tenchi and Ryo-Ohki were underway, Washu turns
around and faces the guardians as
she begins to release them.  "Ok you two, as promised
you are free.  But don't try
to apprehend me if you know what's good for you."
"But Professor we have orders."
"I know that is why I placed a bug in your
internal-net which would shut both of you
off if you ever tried to arrest any one of us living
here."
"The Emperor is not going to like this."
"I know, and I can't wait to see his expression when I
tell him."
"Washu, we don't have to wait long because here they
are."  Stated Sasami.
"Where did Lord Tenchi go?"  Asked Ayeka as she
reached their location.
Sasami simply answered, "Don't worry Ayeka, he just
went with Ryo-Ohki to bring back
Ryoko."
Before Ayeka could respond Emperor Azusa began to yell
at the guardians.
"Azaka, Kamadake inform the ship of the boys
intentions!"
"Your majesty, communications with the ship are being
jammed."
"What!?  How can this be?"  Bellowed the Emperor as he
walked towards the guardians.
"It really bites when your communication link is
blocked, am I right Azusa."  Stated
Washu was presently in her adult form.
"You!  Azaka, Kamadake seize her!"
"No!"  Yelled Sasami as she stepped in-between the
guardians and Washu.
"It's all right Sasami, remember what I said earlier.
They can't arrest any one of
us unless they wish to go off-line."
"This is not over.  Officer Mihoshi, arrest her for
aiding an assassin."
"Alright, Miss Washu, Princess Sasami you two are
under arrest for aiding in the
release of a criminal."
"Not my daughter, just Washu!"
"Father, I helped Miss Washu and Tenchi so Ryoko could
be brought back.  Therefore, I
am equally as guilty."
"Enough Sasami, move out of the way so that Officer
Mihoshi can do her job!"
"Why are you doing this father?  Is it because Tenchi
fell in love with Ryoko instead
of Ayeka?"
"Actually Sasami, I believe it is because he might
lose his hold of power over the
Jurian Empire.  Especially since Tenchi is very well
admired by the people and a
majority of the Jurai Supreme Council."
"I am not afraid of that boy!"
"Well, I guess you won't be bothered if he marries my
daughter."
Not wanting to continue this topic any longer, the
Emperor changed to a different
subject.
"Why did you block communications to my ship?"
"Simple, I didn't want you informing your crew of
Tenchi's intention."
"If he releases her there will be no place for them to
hide in the entire Universe.
I will see to that."
"I doubt that will be the case after you are convicted
for kidnapping, and attempting
to commit murder."
"What!?"  Replied everyone upon hearing the last
statement.
"Well, we could wait here and see what Ryoko has to
say on her defense.  Or..."
"Or what!?"  Replied the Emperor.
"We could view the play back of Ryo-Ohki's memories on
the incident in question.
It's your decision."
"Ugh..."
"Well what is it going to be?"
