Song of My Heart: Flames

Ryoko was uncontios under the tree, when the situation, got worse.  Sparks flew 
about from lightning, not to far from the place in which she was confined, she 
woke up when she smelt the smoke. Fire, she was surrounded by it, she yelled for 
help but no one heard her cry.

"Hey look..." Mihoshi said when she looked out the window. "there's a fire in 
the woods Kiyone..."
"Mihoshi what are you talking about?!?" Kiyone stated, fairly anoyed, that in 
the current situation, her partner was talking about fires, but still, she 
decided to look. "Mihoshi, honestly, there's no fire, oh God.. there's a fire!! 
Ryoko's out there!"
"What are you two talking avout?" Washu said as she looked out the window. 
"Oh... the fire...." she said casually, then turned around and started to walk 
away. "FIRE?!?" she swung her head around and looked out the window.
"We hafta put it out!" Mihoshi cried.
"No kidding..." Kiyone and washu both said.
Everyone else was sitting in the kitchen, and finally decided to respond to the 
commotion.
"Whats going on?" Sasami asked.
"Yea whats all the fire talk?" Yugi said.
"Yea really..." Tenchi said.
"Theres a fire and Ryoko might be in it an-" Mihoshi was cut off when Kiyone 
slapped her hand over Mihoshi's mouth.
"Ryoko is out there, theres a chance she could be in the fire.... I think we 
should go look for her."
"Me too." Yugi and Washu said.
"Well i'm going to look for her weather any of you are or not..." Hotsuma said 
quietly, and walked out into the storm, calling Ryoko's name.

Ryoko teleported out from under the tree that kept her pinned on the ground,  
but she didn't have a lot of energy, so she was afraid to teleport again, afraid 
she would end up in the hot flames.
"Help!!!" She cried, looking for and small gap she could escape through, she 
didn't find one, and the smoke was 
getting thicker. "Help!! somebody!! anybody!!" Ryoko cried as she started to 
breath in the smoke, she coughed and fell to the ground. "please...." she saw a 
figure comeing twords her, but didn't get a chance to make the person out, 
before she blacked out.

A/N- Wow... i hafta thank Luna for her support.... thanks Luna.  I hated this 
chapter. I wasn't happy at all with how it came out, but my prereaders seem to 
think otherwise ^_^; oh well I suppose it's up to you... Who is the figure 
aproaching Ryoko? is it a new enemy? or is it Hotsuma? You'll just hafta wait 
and see! I love you all and reviews are appreciated.
