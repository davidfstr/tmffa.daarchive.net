Washu's Double Trouble


"Miss Washu, there are two girls who wish to see you." the attendant =
said quietly.

Washu looked up. "Okay, send them in." The attendant turned to walk to =
the door. "Oh and Ori,"

The attendant turned around to look at the professor. "Yes?"

"DON'T CALL ME MISS!!!"

"Uh. . .yes, Washu-chan,"=20

The small professor smiled and looked over her documents the the** =
Science Academy had sent her.

"Professor Washu!" The little red-head nearly fell out of her seat. She =
looked up at two green haired girls. Both were wearing huge smiles.

"Asa, Ishi how are the both of you?" Washu asked. The girls were both =
twins, one could easily tell that much of them.=20

Ishi, the girl on the right had her hair in long pig tails and wore an =
Academy uniform in blue. Asa, the girl on the left had her hair the same =
as her sister but her uniform was in purple shades.

"We=92re fine!" they said in unison.

"We were wondering if we could do a report or some thing for extra =
credit?"Asa asked in a cheerful tone.

"Yes, please?" Ishi asked, her eyes pleading.

Washu looked through her grade book. "Well, girls, you have the highest =
GPA (Grade Point Average) in the history of the Science Academy:(except =
for me, of course)a lovely 78,091 points, each. I don=92t think you =
really need any more points."

"Oh but Washu-chan," they both squealed.

Ishi started. "We want to keep our selves in-"=20

"Top working order so we can be-" Asa cut in.

"Great Scientists=92-" Ishi continued.

"Just like you." Asa finished.

It=92s true what they say: =91Imitation is the most sincere form of =
flattery,=92 Washu thought.=20

"Well, write me up a 70 page report on Berkelium and Xenon, Asa.  And =
Ishi, you have a 70 page report on Betta or Fighting fish, native to =
Earth and I want to know every thing about them. Okay?"

"Okay!" the girls exclaimed. Ishi had a puzzled look on her face. "But =
Miss Wash shoes-" Ishi cut herself short as she started laughing.

"Cut, Cut!" the director yelled out.=20

One of the managers walked over to Ishi. "Ishi, you were supposed to say =
=91Washu-chan=92 not =91Miss Washu=92."he said in a very winny voice.=20

"I know, I can=92t help it. . ."she continued to laugh.

"Break!" the director called out to the cast. Asa and Washu were =
standing together on the set.

"God, she is so stupid." Washu said in a surprising French accent.

"I don=92t see how we can be twin sisters. She is really a ditz."=20

"Even more zhan Mihoshi sometimez." Washu said.

"What?!" Washu and Asa turned to see Mihoshi and the rest of the gang =
walking over towards them.

"Not you personally, Mihoshi. Just your character on zhe show.=20

"Oh. . .okay," she giggled her normal giggle as she lit up a Lucky =
Strike.

"Hey Mihoshi, do you really think that=92s safe? You know with the baby =
and all?" Asa asked. "I mean, what if Yosho came over here and caught =
you. He=92d be really upset, seeing how the baby=92s his and all."

"Hummmm. . .your probably right. . ." she snubbed out the cigarette. "I =
really hate all that make up they put on him. He wears more than I do, =
for crying out loud!"

"Hey guys," Ayeka said as she wandered over to Washu, her cheeks a bit =
pink. Washu scrunched up her nose. "Ayeka, are you drinking?"

"Just a little drinky here and there. Is that such a problem?" She asked =
as she took another swig from her saki bottle. Then she looked at Ryoko. =
"Hey Ryoko, want a drinky?"

Ryoko, looked at the bottle distastefully. "No I never touched the =
stuff. I=92m glad they put water in the show instead of real saki, I =
think Ayeka would be drunker than a fish!"

"Daughter, when iz zhe wedding set for you two love birdz?" Washu asked.

"Oh, well, I think me and Tenchi have decide for the 5th of May. How =
does that sound, momma?"

"Oh it sounds wonderful. Oh, Tenchi. . .my son-in-law. . ." Washu =
trailed off and began to sob.=20

"Momma, don=92t cry. Me and Ryoko are here." Cayenne said. trying to =
make her mother feel better.

"And when are you going to get married. Kiyone? I want to here zhe =
pitter-patter of little Kiyone=92s in your house." Washu said, glaring =
at her other daughter.

"Momma, I just haven't=92t found the right man yet-" she was cu off by =
her mother.

"What about zhat man over zhere?" she looked over to Noboyuki=92s =
direction.

"Mother! He is the biggest pervert on this set!" Kiyone said harshly to =
Washu.

"She is right, Mom," Tenchi said, looking over towards Noboyuki. "My =
brother is a bit of a pervert."

"I had to make a choice when I waz your age. Zhat=92s how I met Kagato. =
. ." Washu voice suddenly got dreamy.=20

"You mean DAD?!" Ryoko and Kiyone both said in unison.

"Yes, your father. He was a good man, God rest his soul."=20

Sasami walks over to the group. "Hi, guys. How are you?"=20

Washu turned to Sasami. "Now Sasami, I want you to start calling me =
=91Grandma Washu=92 okay?"=20

Sasami smiled. "Sure." and walked over to see Ryo-Ohki.=20

"Your going to adopt her, right Ryoko?" Kiyone asked her sister.

"Oh, yes, as soon as Tenchi get the custody papers back from Ayeka."

"You divorced Ayeka, right?" Mihoshi had lit up another cigarette, and =
glanced over at Ayeka, who was asleep on the couch.=20

"Yeah, couldn't put up with her cheating on me. I had no choice." Tenchi =
said.

"But you two are still friends?" asked a confused Asa.

"Oh, yeah," Tenchi said.

"In fact, Ayeka=92s going to be my bride=92s maid." Ryoko said.

"If Mommy can lay off the liqueur!" Sasami yelled over to them.

"Oh, and Sasami=92s and Ryo-Ohki are going to be the flower girls." =
Ryoko put in.

"It=92ll be such a sweet wedding. . ." Kiyone trailed off.

"OKAY, you guys, let=92s get back to work." the director shouted. "Will =
somebody get Ayeka some coffee?! Make it black!"

The group grumbled as Ishi, Asa, and Washu all walked back onto the =
classroom scene.

"Okay, Ishi do you know your lines?" the director asked.

"Uh-huh. I think so!" she said.

"Ah, she thinks so. . .Okay from the top. . .Ready. . .Action!"

"Miss Washu there are two girls who wish to see you." the attendant said =
quietly.

Washu looked up. "Okay, send them in." The attendant turned to walk to =
the door. " Oh, and Ori,"

The attendant turned to look at the professor. "Yes?"

"DON=92T CALL ME MISS!!!"

"Yes. . .Washu-chan,"

The small professor smiled and looked over her documents the Science =
academy had sent her.

"Professor Washu!" The little red-head nearly fell out of her seat.  She =
looked up as two green haired girls.  Both were wearing huge smiles.

"Asa, Ishi.  How are both of you?" Washu asked.

"We're fine." they said in unison.

"We were wondering if we could do a report or something for extra =
credit?"  Asa asked in a cheerful tone.
"Yes, freeze?" Ishi asked, then realized what she said, and burst out =
laughing.

"CUT, cut." the director yelled.  Asa sighed.  Washu rolled her eyes.  =
Ishi rolled in the floor.
Then her attendant came over to Ishi.  "Miss Ishi, you really must learn =
your lines!"

Washu and Asa stood at the side. =20
"It's gonna be a long day." Asa said, in a depressed tone.
"It waz not even zhat funny."  Washu slipped back into her French =
accent.
"Hey, I'm gonna go get some saki, k'ers?"  Asa and Washu looked to see =
Ayeka leaving the set area out the door.
"Yes, this is going to be a long day..."  Asa repeated.
