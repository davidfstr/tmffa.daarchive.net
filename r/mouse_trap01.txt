Its a world of mists and shadows. 
Sasami is walking on a narrow path careful so she wont step on any living 
beings, but all the same she has the feeling someone is walking close behind her 
trampling all the insects she is trying to avoid. 
all smiles.. 
Ryoko flies by not aware of the danger up ahead and Sasami screams out 
trying to make her see the danger but Ryoko only laughs and continues on.. 
her sister sits on a bench by the path resting her feet. 
Ryoko flies by.. 
Sasami trips over her own feet as she tries to avoid all the insects.. the 
dead insects starts to make a carpet by her feet and behind her before her 
all around her.. 
Aeka seems to want to come with her but her feet has taken root into the 
ground, her toes buried in the dirt the only thing keeping Aeka from.. from 
what? Aeka's toes are roots .. 
Sasami blinks. roots? but her sister had always been a willful girl one that 
wouldn't take root, that refused to take root what could.. 
the insects is crushed beneath her feet and the person behind her comes 
closer. always holding out a hand there to catch her.. 
Ryoko has landed further up her face radiating happiness as she with a smile 
cuts her own throat.. noo Ryoko? 
Sasami runs up to her crushing more insects why Ryoko why? 
Why doesn't Ryoko regenerate why.. 
A black tentacle shoots out from the mist like a harpoon. Grabbing Ryoko it rips 
her already dead body apart, flailing the pieces all around making it hard to 
see anything else than the blood. 
more mist and shadow tentacles starts to form, and whimpering its all Sasami can 
do not to scream. 
She can hear Washuu's voice and she knows what Washuu is saying must be 
important but she cant make herself hear her or remember.. 
someone is gently stroking her chin and then she does scream.

Hearing A scream from inside Sasami's door, Ryoko quickly phases through the 
wall standing between her and whatever made Sasami scream. 
But what she found was not what she had expected really.. or hoped for.. she 
hated herself for that, she had hoped that somebody had attacked Sasami or 
atleast bothered her so that she could punch the this person REAL hard. 
Last night hadn't been that good with Aeka going on about how, as she put 
it, miss Ryoko should realise that Lord Tenchi wasn't interested in her and that 
she should stop trying to get him in the sack. Whatever she meant by that Ryoko 
could only guess. 
And then Aeka had gone on in such a degree that Tenchi had had no other 
choice but to tell them both to leave him alone and that there sexually 
heated arguments made him sick, as if Ryoko had been thinking about it. 
It was not her fault that people believed all she wanted from Tenchi was 
Sex. Sex was last thing, well maybe not the last thing, she wanted from 
Tenchi. All she wanted from his was him to love her, was that to much to 
ask? Drat that man! 
Well it really wasn't Tenchi's fault, he only thought about her as a friend, but 
sometimes he made her so angry, and Aeka had to take the blows. Well atleast 
Aeka's smug smile had vanished when Ryoko had put Cayenne pepper down her dress, 
and the princess had run wailing all the way to the bathroom were she had try to 
wash it of.. 
Ryoko shoves the hilarious picture of an screaming Aeka out of her mind and 
concentrates on Sasami instead. 
The girl gave Ryoko such a look of shock and terror when Ryoko put a hand on her 
shoulder, that you would think it was down Sasami's dress that Ryoko had shoved 
that Cayenne pepper. 
 "Sasami?" Ryoko asked carefully "whats the matter" 
Sasami blinked tears rolling down her cheeks. "I saw you die,Ryoko. I saw 
you all die...

06.30:am 20/4 
  
Aeka winces when the floor creaks. Oh! don't let her wake the others. 
Oh light! please don't let them wake, not yet. 
Yesterday had been terrible. It had all gone on as usual. Ryoko Swarming 
over Lord Tenchi and Aeka trying to make her stop. 
but yesterday that horrible, horrible woman had stooped to a new level of 
wickedness,as of yet Aeka couldn't have imagined. 
Pouring some sort of herbs down Aeka's dress Ryoko had laughed as the pain 
had sent Aeka running up the stairs, her skin feeling as if it was on fire, and 
when Aeka had tried to shower it away it had only burned worse. Aeka had been 
forced to shower in ICE COLD water to make the herbs stop burning and then her 
skin had been sore anyway. 
As she makes her way down the stairs Aeka makes a small prayer for Ryoko not to 
show up. Even though she rather liked the woman, she admitted grudgingly to 
herself, she was not sure she would be able to keep a proper degree of dignity 
if she encountered her this early. 
The Creaking of the hall floor makes Aeka squint. Why was the floor creaking so, 
didn't it understand that she couldn't afford to wake everybody? a stupid 
thought, of course, yet there it was. Now what was it Sasami used to do when she 
made breakfast? Aeka had never paid much mind to what her sister had been doing 
when she made breakfast, after all you couldn't expect a princess to make her 
own breakfast now could you? An image of Sasami standing in the kitchen lolling 
as she happily slicked some carrots made Aeka want to grunt. Well if she 
remembered correctly Sasami had been using some sort of large bucket sometimes 
when she made lunch. Maybe Aeka could use one too? 
Making her way into the kitchen, Aeka spots a piece of paper on the freezer. 
  
Hi Sasami! this is Sasami. 
remember that you are supposed to make 
porridge today, so don't forget it. 
thank you. 
don't mention it! 
aw.. anyway, I have already made the 
porridge yesterday since I had so much 
spare time so you only have to heat it 
Sasami, oki? 
oki 
/Sasami 
  
Having a hard time to find words that would fitt describing Sasami's note, 
Aeka picks up a Cauldron containing porridge and tries to shove it into the 
oven."Eh miss Aeka you know, it doesn't go there" muffling a scream, Aeka 
quickly turns around all honey and milk, to face Tenchi. "Oh Lord Tenchi I 
didn't know you were up this early.. I was just, eh, using this equipment you 
see" a sweatdrop starts to form on Aeka's cheek. Tenchi only looks amused. "Well 
I better leave you to it then miss Aeka, now with your 
permission?" Tenchi quirks an eyebrow at her, then retreats back to his work in 
the garden outside, leaving Aeka perplexed. He could be so strange 
sometimes Lord Tenchi... and.. with a Start she remembers the porridge. 
Funny Aeka had never pictured herself to do porridge, it was.. strange what you 
did for a man. Picking up the cauldron she puts it on the stove instead. 
What wouldn't she do for Lord Tenchi? nothing.. Aeka confesses to herself. 
There was nothing she wouldn't do for Lord Tenchi and sometimes she thought he 
knew it. That was ridiculous, for sure. Why wouldn't Lord Tenchi do something, 
or atleast tell her that he knew how she felt about him, if he knew? Aeka sighs 
as nothing happens to the cold porridge. 
Maybe if she was a little more like Ryoko? She finds some handles on the 
stove and flicks them all on. No she was not going to behave like that.. 
that woman! Anyway Ryoko didn't seem to have much more luck with Lord Tenchi 
despite all her almost molesting him. No if she wanted to win Lord Tenchi's 
heart she could only do this by being herself.. yet making breakfast wouldn't 
hamper her plans.. 
A heartening scream from upstairs, makes Aeka forget all about breakfast...

06.49:am 20/4 
  
Cradling Sasami, Ryoko frowns at Aeka as she bursts through the door. 
"Whats the matter with Sasami Ryoko! get you hands of her she is my sister!" 
Ryoko's face turns to that one of rage. 
"Oh so the Princess Aeka deigns to care why her sister is crying, does she?" the 
mock in Ryoko's voice is evident and she really hopes Aeka will hear it and 
release how selfish she sounded. After all Aeka's sister was crying, and the 
last thing Sasami needed was to see her, Ryoko argue Aeka over who had the right 
to comfort her. "I don't have to take this from you, you demon! I.." Aeka clamps 
her mouth shut as she finally seems to release that her arguing was both 
childish and immature and was of no help to Sasami. 
Kneeling by her sister instead Aeka puts on a worried frown, but it is to 
Ryoko she turns when she finally speaks "Is she alright?" a hint of anger 
still tings Aeka's voice as she utters the question. Well you really can't 
expect the leopard to change its spots, now could you? 
Ryoko almost sneers, Very well, atleast Aeka's attention was on Sasami 
instead, maybe there was some small scrap of intelligence in Aeka after all. 
"She is alright, I think she only had a nightmare, but she is alright." Ryoko 
mutters in answer. 
Aeka looks at Sasami doubtfully, what was that prissy girl thinking? that 
Ryoko had made her sister cry? that bitch! "No.." Ryoko snaps out of her 
thoughts as Sasami between sobs tries to speak. "no you don't understand, I 
..saw it happen.. I.. saw the future.." 
A deadly silence clouds the room and somehow the air feels thicker. 
it had been a very long time since Sasami had seen the future, maybe it was a 
way of protecting herself against the pain, or maybe the anguish? but ever since 
Sasami had come back from that experience with Yuzuha Sasami seemed to have put 
up bars to block herself from the future. It had passed almost seven years since 
then and Sasami's appearance had changed greatly from that of a small girl to a 
young woman, if not all grown up, but one thing age could never change and that 
was that Sasami would one day become Tsunami and a way to prepare her for this 
had seemed to been the ability to see the future, could the ability have 
returned? or was this just a nightmare? 
Gathering herself Ryoko tries to calm Sasami, if it was a dream about the 
future there was nothing she could do about it, and if it wasn't.. either 
way there was no reason to upset Sasami "Are you sure?" Ryoko asks Sasami 
with mockery in her voice "You know Sasami sometimes even I dream about me 
dying.. most of the times its Aeka boring me to death in those dreams" 
taking no notice of Aeka's sudden glare she pulls Sasami out of bed. "Ryoko what 
are you doi..AAAH" Sasami screams as Ryoko after teleporting them out of there 
drops Sasami in the Lake. "RYOKO!! YOU YOU AAARGH!" Ryoko teleports away from 
Sasami's furry in a hurry. Mission accomplished, maybe Sasami wouldn't think 
Ryoko dying would be such a horrible thought right now? hehehe with an amused 
look on her face she arrives in front of Little Washuu's lab. Sasami had taken 
on a remarkable transformation during these seven last years, which made Ryoko 
question her old believes that the reason Aeka was so annoying was because of 
the way she was raised. Now seeing many of Aeka's annoying "Ability's in Sasami 
also, Ryoko had started to wonder if it wasn't a question of genes after all as 
her mother had suggested some years ago.. well atleast Sasami's taste for Tenchi 
had faded with her maturing and that had been a comfort. 
Opening the door to her mothers lab Ryoko was, as always, amazed at how much 
larger it was from the inside than what it was from the outside. As expected a 
large head sized crystal eye greets Ryoko as she enters. "Ah Ryoko.. please make 
yourself at home, or something. Washuu-chan has expected a visit from you, but 
unfortunately due to an unexpected chance to an unexpected experiment, she cant 
be bothered at the moment, please be patient, I beg of you... Blip!" Glancing at 
the hovering crystal eye beside her Ryoko makes her way through the air 
searching for her mother. That Eye me-o, as her mother called it, was one of her 
worst inventions ever. It had been that way for a while now, little Washuu's 
inventions running wild, and it had all begun one day when little Washuu 
unexpectedly had joined them all for breakfast instead of eating in her lab. In 
a loud voice she had suddenly announced that there wasn't anything interesting 
left to explore in the universe. Since then her moth!
er had tried to defeat her boredom by putting 
'a little flair of love and personality' into her inventions, which this 
crystal eye had proven, was a crazy idea from the beginning.. The thing 
was... Rude at best.. and still the crystal eye was not the worst of the 
bunch, by far. Spotting little Washuu beside a table, building a sandwich of all 
things, Ryoko settles on the ground behind her mother. "Mom?" almost leaping out 
of her chair Washuu swivels around to face her daughter with an almost shocked 
expression on her face, then glares at the Crystal eye "I thought I instructed 
you to tell me if I had Any visitors me-o," she tells the crystal eye with 
incredulity in her voice. Instructed? why had little Washuu laid all of the 
responsibility on this flawed invention? even the red head scientist had 
admitted that you couldn't trust me-o.. "Yes, Washuu-chan but I thought you 
would appreciate a surprise, Blip!" Ryoko watches her mom wave the eye away and 
then turning her attention to her instead. 
"Ryoko, I expected a visit from you, but it seems I was given flawed 
information about the time of your arrival.. never mind. I guess you want to 
talk? yes of course you want.. maybe we could go somewhere else? This lab has of 
late made me feel cramped and confined" As little Washuu makes a gesture for 
Ryoko to lead the way out of the lab Ryoko cant help but 
pondering over the change of her mothers personality. Maybe her wanting to 
put 'a flare of love' into things wasn't such a bad thing? After all wasn't this 
what she always had wanted? what she always had dreamed about? Pulling her 
mother along a pathway to the exit, she fails to see the image of a large 
Spaceship the shape of a one eyed octopus dancing across a monitor....
