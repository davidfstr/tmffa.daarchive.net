		   Chapter 1: The Eternal Sleeper Arises

	Out beyond the reaches of the sun's warm glow, into the vast,
cold reaches of space. An unsettling place past Jurai, that carries a
dark past. The planet known as Hades. Many a king and people have 
settled in this place; but never survived for long. One race after 
another were driven to madness because of an unknown purpose. 
	Each had the same symptoms; a king or ruler out of control, a 
people with extreme distaste for a government they onced loved. And it 
would always end the same way; the world would be divided and each 
division would kill each other off. Until the last few men standing would 
be so distraught each would kill themselves.
	It happened for six hundred years until the king of Jurai found 
out about it and sealed the place off to all. It now today lies dormant,
waiting for its next victims. Waiting to be forgoten so it could destroy
the  seal it held forever. The planet, seems almost, alive.

	Earth was alive and well as the morning sun came over the Masaki
home. Tenchi woke up and looked around the semi-dark room. He opened the
blinds and looked outside.
	'Well, at least Ryoko didn't try and scare me again,' he thought
to himself. He jumped out of bed and heard the sound of something 
chopping in the kitchen. He smiled and walked to the bathroom and reached
for the door handle. It was locked! Tenchi sighed and stood for a while.
He looked around nervously and began to dance about.
	'Come on whoever you are!' he thought furiously. The door began
to open and out of the darkness came a creature with a green face and 
badly messed up hair. Tenchi looked at it wide eyed and screamed. He 
fainted as everyone came rushing out of their rooms. They stopped at 
Tenchi and looked down then up to Ayeka who was still wearing her green 
beauty mask she slept in. She looked up at them then in the mirror.
	"Oh, no wonder, I didn't know I still had that on, s'cuse me!"
she said light-heartedly and she jogged away into her room. Everyone 
then looked at Tenchi who was now recovering from his shock. He looked
up at everyone and turned red.
	"I...if you'll excuse me, I don't need to go anymore," he said
embarrassed. They all looked down at the wet stain on the wood floor 
and started to chuckle a bit. Tenchi got up and ran back to his room 
dripping his urine all the way back. Washu sighed and laughed.
	"Well, what else could go wrong?" she asked everyone and they
all shrugged when suddenly a black smoke rose from the kitchen.
	"Oh no!" Sasami yelled and she ran to the kitchen. Ryoko sighed
and disappeared through the floor as Mihoshi ran down stairs to the 
kitchen and Washu walked back to her lab.

	Out past Jurai and Hades, far away from everything that happened
on Earth a little green light shined. But, this light is not an ordinary
one. This is a status light attatched to a glass casket. The casket 
floats freely throughout space without worry. But after floating for as
long as it has, it is rusted and worn. Today, will be the final flight.
A comet headed straight for it, fortunatly missing its cargo. The casket,
caught by the comets tail, was pelted by the rocks and dust expeled from
the comets body. The light suddenly went red and an alarm sounded as the
once strong seal broke and the body was free.
	It was a human figure with a gotee and long black hair, his face
and body was an icy blue. He wore black armor with spikes protruding from 
the shoulders. A white cape flowed out of the prison as it floated into 
the comets tail. The being awoke with red eyes, as if they were taken over
by flames. He sleepily looked about and noticed he was free. He smiled
then laughed evily. He sent a shock wave of energy out from his body that
shattered both the casket and the comet. Looking about he looked toward a
nebula and smiled again.
	"That way," he said and flew off toward the nebula.

	Washu looked at her computer in surprise. An oscilliscope line 
spiked off the chart.
	"What the hell was that!?" she yelled and looked at the figures
scratching her head. "I don't understand how so much pure energy could 
form into one point." Just as she was about to call everyone Ayeka came
through the door. 
	"Mrs. Washu," she said.
	"I see you felt it also."
	"I recognize that foul enrgy, it is Galaxy Police number 04457,
Atmos." Washu looked up at her in fear and then bowed it back down.
	"So, he came back."
	"But how did you know?"
	"Oh I knew him, he was a little troublemaker in school."
	"You two attended school?"
	"Yes, but at that point we didn't know about his hidden power
and neither did he. But then, a wizard charmed him, and his true power
came out. He took revenge on the academy and on everyone who made fun
of him. Fortunatly everyone at the academy sensed this would happen
and moved. Thats when the king of Jurai moved in. He detained Atmos
and sent him into space, since then, I didn't think he survived, I
guess I was wrong," she finished explaining and looked at Ayeka and
the distress on her face.
	"So, that kid..."
	"Man, if he survived that long he is a full grown man now."
	"Right, so, what can we do about him?"
	"We wait for the next energy fluxuation, until then he could be
anywhere."
	"Okay," Ayeka said and began to walk away.
	"Oh, and Lady Ayeka," Washu called.
	"Yes?"
	"Don't say anything to any of the others, okay?"
	"Certainly," Ayeka nodded and walked out the portal door. Washu
looked down and thouught a bit.
	'If it is him, we need to be fully prepaired for the worst. Hmm,
maybe I should tell Tenchi...'
	"Naw, he'll fell it eventually and come running in here," she 
told herself and walked back to her computer which had now fried. "I 
guess that last energy wave was too much." She sighed and brought up 
another computer. 

	Atmos now arrived at the nebula and looked around the 
destruction. He sneered a bit until he saw a large asteroid.
	"It's still here!" he said excitedly. He flew over to it and
put his hands on it. He then rubbed some of the rock and dirt away to
reveal some metal.
	"Damn, its in bad shape, but I'll fix that." He flew away from 
it and put his hands in front of him. A soft blue glow resonated off of
them and a beam of the energy came down on the asteroid. It covered it
making it twist into different forms. 
	"I will give you a new body old friend, better than you once
were, faster than you could ever imagine, more powerful than Tsunami,
and smarter than Washu," he said as a flat deck came out and three 
ovals, one on top of the other, each bigger then the last, above the 
engine. The ship looked like a hammerhead shark and Atmos laughed.
	"Now arise Galvitros!" he yelled as the ship moaned a little.
"Now, I must drop a visit to Tokimi, I haven't seen her in ages!" he 
said  and disappeared into the ship that sped off after he was in. As 
it sped off an everlasting evil laugh was heard.

	Washu once again looked at her computer in surprise. She 
watched the ocsilliscope line bounce up into a spike only not as 
high as last time. She examined the output and sighed.
	"Great, its in the middle of no where, I can't put a trace
on that place," she said and then put her hand on her head. "I need
to relax, maybe a bath will help." She jumped off of her floating 
pillow and walked out of her lab.
	Outside the lab Ayeka, Ryoko, and Mihoshi were watching TV
while Sasami stood in the kitchen and washed the dishes. She walked 
to the bathroom and grabbed a robe. Ryoko flew to the closed door and
tapped on it.
	"Hey, Washu," she said.
	"Ryoko, what have I told you?" she asked annoyed
	"Okay, Mom, did you feel something earlier?" Washu looked up
to the door worried.
	"No, now how about a bath with your mom?" she asked nearly 
stuttering.
	"Uh, well, I don't think so."
	"Oh, okay," Washu said and walked out of the bathroom, wearing 
a pink robe, and then to the bath. Ryoko watched her for a second then 
flew back to the couch. 
	'Well, thats something else, since Ryoko and I are linked we
basically feel the same energy reactions, this could be a problem,'
thinking to herself as she opened the door to the bath and having the 
steam hit her.
	"Oh well, I'm just gonna have to tell her to keep quiet. But my
consern lies with the fact that he is loose and could strike anything 
at anytime. We might need to fight him, and if so, I don't think even
Tenchi will stand up to him." She walked into the bath water, laid
down and sighed. She looked up through the steam at the sky and the
clouds. The steam swirled around the window and a red streak went by 
the window. Washu's eyes went wide with fear as she gasped.
	Ryoko looked up and disappeared through the celing. Ayeka and
Mihoshi looked up as she did it quickly. They looked at one another 
and Ayeaka suddenly gasped in fright. Mihoshi looked at her until her
wristband went off. She looked at it and pressed the button. She got 
up quickly and then knew the reason for the scare.
	"Its number...04457!" she screamed.
	"At..mos!" Ayeka yelled in fear. They both ran to the door then
outside to see Ryoko standing on the roof. She stared at the red comet 
that passed by and growled.
	"Atmos you coward get down here!" she called up to it.
	'Ryoko, don't entice him!' Washu yelled in Ryoko's mind. Ryoko
snarled and floated to the ground.
	
	Inside his ship, Atmos looked down on the Earth. His eyes 
narrowed and he laughed. 
	"That can't possibly hold the boy who creates the Light Hawk
Wings," he said to himself and typed on a keypad. Figures jumped on a 
screen before him and a camera shot showed him Tenchi.
	"That is him? That is the one the defeated Kagato? It can't be.
Wait, whats that?" He typed some more and a shot of the bath came up 
with Washu looking through the window.
	"It...it's Washu. How in the hell is this possible?" he asked.
"I've already drawn enough attention here with these fools, it is time
I headed for my main goal, Tokimi." He hit more keys and the ship sped 
off into the vastness of space.
	
	Tenchi looked up from the fields he plowed as the red comet 
streaked through the sky. He watched it bounce off the atmosphere and
fly off. He wiped the sweat off from his brow and continued.
	Washu continued to look at the sky and soon sank into the hot
water. She kept her eyes on the blue sky where she had seen a ghost
from her past.
	'Damn, he knows where I am and that Lord Tenchi has the power
to yeld Light Hawk Wings. He may return to attack...' she thought and
sank farther into the bath water while closing her eyes. 'I need to 
tell Tenchi soon, just right after this bath, I need to relax now.'
She sighed and laid back again.
