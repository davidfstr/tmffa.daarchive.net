                                        --- Tenchi Muyo ---
                                        "Sins not Forgotten"

                                           - Chapter One -
                                         "New Year of Hope"

Darkness...         "Where am I?" ...pain... "Who am I?" ...pain... 
"What am I?" Darkness... 

A red jewel glimmers amidst a massive forehead as D3 stares down at a large
chemical vat. 

"Soon your restoration will be complete. And where one has failed you shall succeed. 
All to the will of Lady Tokimi."

"...3...2...1...Happy New Year!" Everyone shouted in unison.

 "Alright!..." exclaimed Ryoko "Let's get this party started!" 

As if on cue Nobuyuki clicked off the television and clicked on the stereo and music 
filled the room as Katsuhito began to pour drinks. 

"Sasami will you get the food from the kitchen?" he asked. 

"Oh yes, certainly." replied Sasami 

"I'll help you Sasami." Tenchi said, as he looked around the family room of the 
Masaki household. 

Ryoko downed her fourth saki as Washu snatched the bottle from her 

"Hey! crazy girl. Save some for the rest of us would you."

"Alright .... MOM!" Ryoko snarled.  

Kiyone and Mihoshi were busy with the karaoke player in the corner. 

"Let's do this one Kiyone. Please." asked the blonde haired GP officer. 

"Mihoshi..." her partner pleaded "We ALWAYS do that one. Just once can't we try something 
new for a change?" 

"B-but this one is my favorite." cried Mihoshi as tears rimmed her eyes. 

"Oh all right." said Kiyone in a defeated tone. 

"Oh thank you, thank you Kiyone." giggled Mihoshi. 

As Tenchi continued to look out upon his friends and family his gaze settled on Nobuyuki,
his father and Katsuhito, his grandfather. Both were standing at the makeshift bar that 
Nobuyuki had built for special occassions and parties. 

"Hey, dad, where's Ayeka?" He shouted over the music. 

"Here I am Lord Tenchi." Ayeka replied as she came down the stairs into the family room. 
The Jurai born princess took a glass offered by Katsuhito and walked over to Tenchi 

"Is Mayuka sleeping ok?" he asked.

"Like a baby." Ayeka giggled as she sipped her drink. 

"Well of course she is." Washu suddenly stated from the bar. "Do you doubt the greatest 
scientific genius in the universe." 

Tenchi only smiled ,he knew better. Washu had spent most of the day soundproofing the 
nursery so that Mayuka could sleep undisturbed by the party. Also sensors placed throughout 
the room would alert anyone in the family room if she woke up needing to be changed and/or 
fed. 

Ryoko suddenly materialized next to Tenchi "C'mon Tenchi, ditch the princess and sit with 
me at the bar. I've got a suprise for you."

"Su-suprise... what sort of suprise?" he asked sheepishly 

"Oh just something I've been saving for tonight." Ryoko replied as she looked upward. 

Tenchi follwed her gaze as he suddenly realized a twig of mistletoe was suspended directly 
over his head. 

"Oh you horrible woman." Ayeka shouted " How dare you, that plant has no meaning now, it was
supposed to be used during the last holiday we celebrated not this one." 

"So, is that why you have a box of these stashed in you closet, hmmmm. Hoping to get lucky 
next year." Ryoko accused. 

"Now see here..." Ayeka began 

"Hey now that looks good." Nobuyuki exclaimed. 

"Ahhh sustanance!" shouted Washu as she darted past the trio. 

Ryoko ,Tenchi and Ayeka turned to see Sasami setting the last plate of food down on the 
table, Ryo-ohki hopped about looking for the carrots that Sasami had put down earlier. 

"Myaa, Myaa" came the excited voice of the little cabbit as she found her prize. 

"I'm sorry Sasami." Tenchi apologized "I had really meant to help you." 

"It's alright Tenchi." she replied "You can help me do the dishes in the morning." she said 
giggling softly.

"Oh ok then." said Tenchi as he helped himself to some snacks. 

Their argument temporarily on hold Ayeka and Ryoko had also began helping themselves to the 
elaborate mini-banquet Sasami had prepared. As everyone settled in around the table Mihoshi 
and Kiyone began their rendition of Sammi Cheng and Utada Hikaru's hit 
"Forever is Not Enough".


Darkness...   pain... light "Light!?  Darkness....   light... pain...
"What is this? Why can't I remember?..." Darkness

Sunlight crept into Tenchi's room warming his face and forcing him awake.
Rubbing the sleep from his eyes he sat up in bed enjoying the temporary quiet offered by 
the morning. His enjoyment came to an end when he heard noises coming from the yard below. 
Look down out of his window he saw Ayeka with Mayuka cradled in her arms headed to the onsen. 

'Ryoko must be hungover.' he mused silently, as it was customary that Ryoko usually gave 
Mayuka her morning bath while Ayeka did so in the evenings.

'One day I'll have to choose.' he thought to himself 'But for now a quick bath and some 
breakfast.'  As he left his room and walked down the hallway to the bathroom he could only 
smile as he heard Kiyone downstairs pleading with Mihoshi.

"C'mon Mihoshi or we'll be late." Kiyone begged "We have to be on patrol in ten minutes." 

"But Kiyone I'm still sleepy... can't I finish my coffee first."

"You've already had a whole pot!" shouted Kiyone "Now let's get moving."

Grabbing her partner by the collar Kiyone stood up and began heading for the door 

"Please Kiyone just one more." begged Mihoshi. 

"NO! now get moving." Kiyone shouted as she dragged Mihoshi out the door behind her.

"Have fun girls." Washu said as she entered the kitchen "Anything special on the menu today? 
Sasami." she asked 

"Not this morning." Sasami replied sleepily. "I have to finish the dishes from last night." 

Washu began searching the cabinets for a quick meal as Tenchi entered the kitchen. 
"Good mrning, Sasami, little Washu." 

"Good morning, Tenchi." the girls replied in unison.

"Sasami, I'll finish the dishes. Why do you go sit down and relax. Dad's in the family room 
watching TV I'm sure he'd love some company." 

"OK, Tenchi." Sasami replied as she took off her apron and headed out of the kitchen. 
Ryo-ohki jumped atop Sasami's head and both headed to the couch to relax.

Just then Ayeka came in carrying Mayuka, folled by Katsuhito 

"Oh good morning Lord Tenchi, Miss Washu." Ayeka said as she handed Mayuka off to Washu. 
"I take it that devil Ryoko is still in her room with a hangover." she remarked. 

"Not quite little miss nosy." Ryoko said groggily as she materialized beside Washu who was 
busy preparing formula for Mayuka and a bowl of instant breakfast for herself. 

"Here, Washu I'll feed her." Ryoko said only half awake. 

"Not likely." Washu replied "Your in no condition to feed yourself at the moment, much less 
a baby" 

"What do you know... " Ryoko started but never finished as she fell back into a nearby chair
 asleep again. 

"Hmmph that's just like you Ryoko." Ayeka shouted at her "You party all night then come 
morning you use it as an excuse to shrug out of your duties." 

"Easy Ayeka." Washu said calmly "When she finally wakes up she'll demand her time with 
Mayuka. For now why don't you help her back to bed." 

"Your right." she agreed reluctantly "I hate to admit it but she has developed a semblance 
of responsibilty over the past couple of weeks."

"It's almost scary really." Ayeka stated as she helped Ryoko to her feet and guided her out 
of the kitchen to her room upstairs. 

Washu smiled at the two rivals as they left then turned to Tenchi "When Ryoko wakes up tell 
Mayuka will be with me in the lab." 

"Ok little Washu I will." he replied as Washu headed out of the kitchen.

Katsuhito sipped loudly at his second cup of tea. 

"Huh?... Oh good morning grandpa." Tenchi said as he turned around "I didn't notice you c
ome in." he added apologetically. "I didn't think we were going to train today."

"We're not." Lord Katsuhito replied "But I recieved a phone call this morning, and as a 
result I have an errand for you to run." 

"What kind of phone call, what kind of errand." Tenchi asked his grandfather curiously. 

"Well..." Katsuhito began "I recieved the phone call from a fellow priest who heads a shrine
in Tokyo. He has for the past few days been entertaining a rather unique guest at his shrine.
He said this young man has been travelling to historic shrines all over Japan , and 
apparently after hearing the legend of the great samurai Yosho's victory over an evil demon 
over seven hundred years ago." Katsuhito chuckled as he sipped his tea. "He now wants to come 
here. To see the demon's cave for himself." 

"He wants to what...!" Tenchi shouted "B-but why..?" 

"Curiosity I suppose." his grandfather replied. "So you want me to show him the shrine and 
the cave then huh?" Tenchi asked

"Yes." replied Kasuhito "After you pick him up from the shrine in Tokyo.

"Pick him up?" Tenchi asked "If he wants to see it so bad why doesn't he drive himself out 
here?" 

"That's the thing Tenchi this gentleman is on foot. My friend said he was prepared to walk 
here from Tokyo but after hearing a weather report the priest called me and asked if I would 
help." Kasuhito said with a stern look "And as a priest myself I cannot exactly refuse. Now 
get moving boy it's a bit of a drive to Tokyo." 

As Tenchi finished up the dishes he had been washing his grandfather tossed him the keys to 
the family van.

"You'll be needing these." he said as Tenchi caught them "Nobuyuki must have dropped them at 
the shrine yesterday. I found them this morning while sweeping the steps." Tenchi only nodded 
as he grabbed a coat and headed out the door.

D3 stared down at the swirling green liquid inside a large vat. The liquid was capable of 
restoring and regenerating anything place in it as long as at least one cell of it's being 
remained. 

"Soon... " he said to the entity inside the fluid.
"Soon you will be whole again... But you will not be free."

Darkness... pain... Light "Soon" a voice was heard saying, pain... Light...
"Soon..." it said again... "whole..." "free..."   Darkness...

====================================================
 Who is the stranger who wants to visit the Masaki shrine and see the demon's cave, why does 
he want to see it. What or who is D3 rebuilding in the vat? And what is Lady Tokimi's stake 
in all this, will Ryoko recover from her hangover, will Sasami be able to survive in the 
company of Nobuyki?
Keep your eyes open folks. Who knows what's going to happen next.
