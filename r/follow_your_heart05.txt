Tenchi Muyo:  Follow Your Heart
Chapter 5

"Ryo-Ohki, how long before we intercept Azusa's ship?"
"Miya." //six hours. //

***********************************************

"Detective Mihoshi, arrest her."
"Azusa, I wonder what your people would say if they
found out
you falsely accused my daughter of the crime in
question.  And
are now planning to murder her just so you can
continue to rule
Jurai."
"How dare you attempt to black mail me with such false
accusations.  I will not tolerate this kind of
treatment any longer.
Detective Mihoshi, I will require the use of your ship
for the sole
purpose of apprehending both Tenchi Misaki and
Ryo-Ohki."
"Yes sir.  Ugh…wait a minute.  Excuse me Miss Washu, I
need
to ask you a favor.  Could you fix my ship?"
"What!?" shouted the Emperor.

************************************************

Since the Emperors ship had already transferred Ryoko
onto a
second ship and were presently returning to Earth,
Tenchi met
them in four hours instead of the six hours predicted
by
Ryo-Ohki.  Tenchi hails the ships captain as soon as
they got
close to the Jurains firing range.
"Jurain vessel, this is Prince Tenchi Misaki.  I would
like to have
a word with your captain."
"This is captain Gateaux, how may I help you prince
Misaki?"
"Captain Gateaux, I would like to have your permission
to come
on board and discuss some arrangements for my
honeymoon with
princess Ayeka."
"Congratulations on you're wedding my prince and
please come
aboard."
Once inside the ship, Tenchi goes with the captain to
discuss
arrangements for his make believe honeymoon with
Ayeka.  While
on another part of the ship Ryo-Ohki is searching for
Ryoko.
When her search was concluded, Ryo-Ohki reported to
Tenchi
about her findings.
"What!?"
"Excuse me Prince Misaki, is there a problem?"
Realizing he made a mistake, Tenchi decides to forgo
the facade
and ask the captain a forward question.
"Captain Gateaux, where is Ryoko?"
"What?"
"Where is Ryoko?" asked Tenchi once more in a stern
voice.
"That piece or trash was dealt with already.  She gave
us some
trouble before we transported her to the second ship.
But we
took care of her." Stated the Captain as he grinned.
Unfortunately for him Tenchi formed an energy sphere
in his left
hand and embraced its power as he took a swing at the
Captain.
Causing Gateaux to be thrown  to the wall by the force
of the
impact.  As he tried to overcome the dizziness he
felt, Tenchi
rushed toward him.  Activating both Tenchi-ken and a
sword
similar to Ryoko's, he crossed both weapons as he
lunged
forward ensnaring Gateaux by his neck.  As the blades
of both
weapons touched every so often, the crackle of energy
produced
by them was deafening.  Bringing the blades of both
weapons
closer to the Captains neck, Tenchi shouted "Where is
Ryoko!?"
The first officer started to move toward Tenchi but
was stopped
when Tenchi faced him and the crew with an enraged
expression
which promised ungodly amounts of pain to any
individual who
stood in his way.  Turning back toward the captain, he
repeated
his question.
"That piece of garbage is no more." Replied Captain
Gateaux.
"Where is she!?"  bellowed Tenchi as he brought the
blades close
together causing Gateaux to scream in pain as the
blades began to
create two burn marks on his neck.
"She is being transported to Jurai on one of our
battle ships, where
she is to be eliminated."  Stated the first officer in
the hopes of
saving his Captain.
As Tenchi began to release the pressure on the
captain's neck,
Gateaux stated.
"Why would you concern yourself over someone as
worthless as
her.  Besides, there is nothing you can do to rescue
her."
'Ryo-Ohki lets get out of here.'
Without warning, the ship was rocked by the
transformation of
Ryo-Ohki ripping threw its halls causing several of
the crew to be
thrown around.  At the same time, Tenchi nailed a
solid front kick
to Gateaux mid-section as he deactivated his weapons.
As
Gateaux fell forward, Tenchi rammed the hilt of
Tenchi-ken to the
back of his head knocking the captain unconscious
before he hit
the floor.
"That was for Ryoko." Stated a very pissed-off Tenchi
to the
prone form before him.
Leaving the Emperor's ship and it's shocked crew,
Tenchi tossed
the black cube, which Washu had gave him, behind him.

*************************************************

'Mother Washu.'
'Tenchi.  Did you find Ryoko?'
'No, she was transferred to a Jurian battle ship.'
'Hold no, let me see if I can locate them for you.'
'Mother Washu?'
'Yes Tenchi.'
'What was that black cube you gave me?'
'Like I said, it was a present for Azusa's crew.  All
it does is slow
the ships travel speed and disrupts all forms of
internal
communications by replaying a annoying musical piece
which can
not be turned off by anyone other than me.'
'So its not some thing harmful?'
'Of course not Tenchi.  Why do you ask?  Oh, I see,
you left it
with them.'
'Yes.'
Laughing a bit at the possible results, Washu
contemplates how
long of a journey Azusa's crew can expect.   <Well it
should take
the Emperors ship two weeks to reach Earth. >  Causing
her to
laugh all over again.
'What is so funny Mother Washu?'
(At this point we see the crew of the Emperor's ship
trying to shut
down all monitor and internal communications.  As a
purple portly
dinosaur is dancing and singing its trade mark song
over and over.)
'Nothing.  I've found their location.'
'Where are they?'
'Not that far from your present location.  Although
there appear to
be approximately ten vessels in a close cluster moving
past the last
planet.'
'We are on our way.'
'Take care you two, this one is not going to be easy.'

**************************************************

When Washu steps outside her lab everyone, except
Emperor
Azusa, asks her if there is any news on Tenchi.
"Calm down, all of you.  Tenchi and Ryo-Ohki are fine.
 They have
already searched Azusa's ship for Ryoko and did not
find her there.
But they were informed that Ryoko was transported to a
second
vessel heading for Jurai where she is to be executed."
"What!?" shouted everyone.
"They should be reaching the other ships in a couple
of hours so all
we can do now is wait for Tenchi to call back."
"Washu-chan you said ships, is there more than one
ship taking
Ryoko to Jurai." Asked Sasami.
"Yes Sasami, it appears that there are nine ships
protecting the one
Ryoko is being held in."
"Can you tell me which ship is the one in the center."
 Asked Lady
Funaho.
"I don't know yet.  But I will inform you as soon as I
can get an
identification on it."

**************************************************

A couple of hours later, at a distance not far from
the planet Pluto.
"Captain Lye, there is a vessel closing in from behind
at an alarming
speed."
"Can you identify it?"
"Wait one, sir."
<It couldn't be him, could It.> wondered the Captain
as he waited
for a response from his first officer.
"Sir, it is the Ryo-Ohki."
"The Ryo-Ohki, open a communication link with it."
"Sir."
"I want to know if they represent a threat to us or
not."
"Sir, Captain Paulaner is hailing us."
"What does he want now."  Asked Lye in an annoyed
tone.
"Sir.  He asks if we are aware that Ryo-Ohki is
closing in on our
position and what is our plan of attack."
"Tell him and the rest of the ships to hold their
positions and not do
anything unless we come under fire first."

**************************************************

"Ryo-Ohki, how much more time until we intercept
them?"
"Miya, miya, miya."
"Okay, okay, I'll stop asking.  I'm just wondering how
we will
handle this new situation.  I don’t believe that the
deception  we
used before will work again.
"Miya."
"What?  How far are they?"
"Miya, miya, miya."
"So this Captain Lye wishes to communicate with us."
"Miya, miya."
"I agree, it could be a trap.  But maybe we can use
this toward
our advantage.  Ryo-Ohki is there possible way for you
to hack
into the ships computer system and locate Ryoko, while
I talk to
the Captain."
"Miya."
"Good, lets do it.  But let's remain alert.  I have a
funny feeling
about this."

************************************************

"Pilot of the Ryo-Ohki, this is Captain Tsarron Lye of
the Jurain
battle cruiser Altbier.  State your purpose for
following us."
"Captain Lye.  This is Prince Tenchi Misaki of the
Jurain Royal
Family.  As to the purpose for my following your ship
is simple.
I am searching for an acquaintance of mine, the space
pirate
Ryoko."
As the statement was made, the transmission between
the two
ships was cut off as Ryo-Ohki was hit by a shot fired
by one of
the Jurai ships.
"Evasive maneuvers Ryo-Ohki!"  bellowed Tenchi as he
started
to get off the floor.
"Miya, miya, miya."
"Damit.  We can't destroy any of the ships since we
don’t know
which one she might be in."
"Miya, miya."
"Well she might be on his ship but lets not take any
chances."
Replied Tenchi as Ryo-Ohki was hit by a couple of more
shots.
"Can we disable the ships without destroying them?"
"Miya."
"Fire Ryo-Ohki!"
Back in Captain Lye's ship the crew scrambles to find
out who
fired the shot in question.
"Who gave the order to fire!"  Shouted Captain Lye.
"Sir it appears that the origin of the blast came from
Captain
Paulaner's ship."
"Open a communications line with that nitwit now!"
"Yes sir."
"Who gave you permission to fire Captain Paulaner?"
demanded
Captain Lye.
"Captain Lye, I am following our orders as dictated by
our
Emperor.  And they clearly state that we are not to
allow any
ships to stop us from transporting the prisoner to
Jurai."
"I know what our orders are!  But until you are placed
in-charge
of this mission, you will follow my orders.  Is that
understood!"
"Yes Captain Lye."
"Well now due to your incompetence, we will have to
disable
them in order to prevent any further interruptions.

Back at the Misaki residence both family and guests
sit together
as they eat their evening meal.  Stepping out of her
lab Washu
searches for one individual.
"Hello everyone, how is dinner?"
"Little Washu, have you heard form Tenchi and Ryoko
yet?"
asked both Lady Funaho and Sasami.
"No, not yet."
"Miss Washu, where is Lord Tenchi!"  bellowed Ayeka as
she
was beginning to lose her nerve and wanted to know
some
answers to his present situation.
Looking sternly at the princess, Washu replies.  "What
did you
call me?"
"Ugh…Little Washu.  I meant to say little Washu."
Replied a
startled Ayeka.
"Good. Now as I had said before, Tenchi is still
looking for
Ryoko and will call me once they are both safe."
After hearing this everyone began to leave the table
and let the
red hair scientist eat her meal in peace.
"Lady Funaho could you help me with an important
matter in my
lab?"  replied Washu as she grabbed a plate of food to
go.
"Of course Little Washu."
Once inside the lab Washu turns on several monitors
and informs
Lady Funaho of a plan to help Tenchi.  Looking at one
of the
monitors while explaining her plan Washu stopped and
paid
closer attention to the situation on the screen.
"Lady Funaho, can you identify this ship?"
"That is the Altbier, its Captain is an outstanding
officer by the
name of Tsarron Lye."
"Well it looks as if he is willing to avoid any
unnecessary
confrontation by talking with Tenchi."
"Oh yes, he used to be one of my best intelligence
officers before
he was given command of his own battle cruiser.  He
prefers to
find out the intentions and as much information of his
adversaries
before making any decision which involve combat."
"What the…"  stated Washu as she turned form the blank
monitor
to her computer.
After reading the information coming back from
Ryo-Ohki she
informs Lady Funaho of the new situation.
"They are under attack."
"Who fired the first shoot."
"From what Ryo-Ohki is sending back it appears that
one of the
Jurain vessels fired first."
"Little Washu, can you open a communications line with
Captain
Lye's ship."
At the same moment a knock is heard from the closet
door that
leads into Washu's lab.
"Who is it?  I'm busy at the moment, come back at a
later time."
"Little Washu, it's me Misaki"
"Lady Misaki."
"Sister get in here.  We need your help."

*************************************************

"Ryo-Ohki, target the ship that fired at us first.
I'm about to try a
maneuver I saw on an animation program."
"Miya!"
"We don't have any other choice."
"Miya, miya, miya."
Firing a blast in front of the targeted ship they were
able to conceal
their actual intended maneuver.  Once in place,
Ryo-Ohki fired a
second shot at the crafts starboard side disabling its
weapons and
main engines.  Using the same maneuver but with
various changes to
which ships were the actual targets they were able to
immobilize four
more vessels.
"Who says you can't learn any thing useful from
animation, aye
Ryo-Ohki."
"Miya."

**************************************************

Quickly informing Lady Misaki of the situation at
hand, Washu
activates the communication line to the Altbier.
"Captain, there is an incoming communication form the
planet Earth."
"Is it Emperor Azusa?"
"No sir, it is the empresses."
"Which one?"
"Both, sir." Answered the communications soldier
nervously.
"Open the com-line soldier.  Don't keep them waiting."
"Y...Y..Yes sir."
As the view screen comes on both Captain and crew see
a stern
faced Lady Funaho and a pissed off Lady Misaki causing
everyone
to sweat at the thought of the probable pain to be
inflicted by her
personally.
"My ladies, how can I be of service to you?"
"Captain Tsarron Lye.  It has come to our attention
that your men
are presently engaged in a battle with the Ryo-Ohki."
"Yes Lady Funaho, that is correct."
"Stop this battle now!!!"  bellowed Lady Misaki into
the screen.
"Yes my lady."  Turning to the communications officer,
Captain Lye
relays the order.
"Sir, half of our ships are still engaged in battle."
"Tell them to cease fire at once.  That is a direct
order from both
Empresses Funaho and Misaki."
"Captain."  Called Lady Funaho.
"Yes my lady?"
"Is the space pirate Ryoko in your custody?"
"Yes she is my lady, as dictated by your husbands
orders she is
being detained within a cell in the ships brig."
"Captain, I want  you to release her and put her in
one of the royal
guest suits.  Also, Prince Misaki will be joining you
shortly and will
be Ryoko's caretaker on your return trip to Earth."
"My lady, what of your husbands orders?"
"These new orders take precedence at the moment.  Is
that
understood?"
"Yes Empress Funaho."
"Captain, one more thing.  Since we know how this
scrimmage
began, please bring the Commanding officer of the
vessel that fired
the first shot.  My sister would like to have a couple
of words with
him."
"Yes Empress Funaho."

***************************************************

"Any ideas why they stopped firing at us Ryo-Ohki?"
"Miya."
Appearing on a screen before him is Washu, Lady Funaho
and Lady
Misaki.
"Hi Tenchi."  Greeted all three together.
"Hello Ladies Funaho, Misaki and Mother Washu."
"Thought we should give you a helping hand." Replied
Washu.
"Tenchi, Ryoko is in Captain Lye's ship and has been
moved into
the royal guest suit.  Also, he is expecting you and
will be your host
on your return trip back home."  Stated Lady Funaho.
"Did the Captain say anything about Ryoko's
condition?"
"No, all he said was that she was being held in a
cell.  Why, is there
something we should know about?"
"Captain Gateaux said that he had to knock her
unconscious to avoid
any possible escape attempts."
"Sister, I guess I will have to deal with him as
well."
"No need to concern yourself Lady Misaki.  I have
taken care of it
already."  Stated Washu with a mischievous grin.

*****************************************************

In the Emperors ship we see a groveling Captain
Gateaux clamor.
"Help me mommy, make the bad thing go away.  Mommy!!!"
 As the
ships’ monitors feature the purple menace while its
music play is being
played through the intercom system at maximum volume.

*****************************************************

Once aboard the Altbier, Captain Lye greets Tenchi.
"Prince Misaki, welcome to the Altbier."
"Thank you Captain.  But can you take me to Ryoko."
"Of course.  Please follow me, I'll take you to her
room."
"Captain, can you tell me how she is doing."
"At the present, she is sleeping."

******************************************************

"Sister, how long did Captain Lye say he would take to
reach Earth?"
asked Lady Misaki.
"Captain Lye assured us that he would arrive by
tomorrow afternoon."
"That's great.  We have plenty of time to set up a new
wedding for
Tenchi and Ayeka."
"Sister, it would be best if we waited to find out
what happened
between Ryoko and Ayeka."
"Funaho, are you implying that our husband lied."
"What I am saying is that we must not jump to
conclusion at this time.
We have only heard one person's side of the story at
this point.  We
must give Ryoko a chance to tell us her view of the
incident in question."
"Very well sister, we will wait to see the outcome of
this situation.  But
after this is settled, Tenchi and Ayeka can be wed."

********************************************************

Finally arriving at Ryoko's room, Tenchi sees that she
is indeed sleeping.
Walking over to the bed, he leans over and gently
moves a couple of
strands of hair from her face.
"Ryoko, its me Tenchi are you okay."  When there was
no movement on
her part, he reached for her hand and held it in a
firm yet tender hold.
Sitting next to her, he continued to speak to her as
he tried to hold back
the tears.  "Ryoko, please wake up.  It's me Tenchi.
(Tenchi begins to
cradle her in his arms as the tears start to descend
down his face.)
"Please don’t leave me Ryoko, I love you.  I love
you."  Repeated
Tenchi as he held her within his arms.  Hearing the
faint murmur of a few
words, Ryoko slowly begins to stir as she tries to
wake up from her
slumber.  Engulfed by the excitement that she may wake
up soon Tenchi
call to her once more.
"Ryoko."
As she slowly started to open her eyes the brightness
of the light in the
room caused her to shut them back up immediately.
<Ouch.  My head is still ringing from that blast, I
need to wait a bit more
before I do try that again.>
<Ryoko its okay, just relax a bit.  I'll be here with
you.>  stated Tenchi
through the mental link as he lightly kissed her
cheek.
<Tenchi!> Yelled Ryoko through her mind as she tried
once more in vein
to open her eyes.
<Ryoko, please relax.  I'm right her.  I am not going
to leave you ever
again.>  Replied Tenchi as he kissed her passionately.
<Tenchi, how is this possible.>
<Well Washu and Tsunami used the gems imbedded in
Tenchi-ken to
make a replica which they bestow onto me.  Providing
me with a chance
to talk to you mentally.  Also, I am able to summon
the same abilities,
which you were provided. >
<Why Tenchi?>
<Because I want to be closer to you.  Also, I want you
to always know
how I feel about you.>
<Tenchi…>
<Wait Ryoko.  I have something to give you.>  replied
Tenchi as he
touched his gem with hers.
Ryoko began to feel a bit dizzy as the information in
Tenchi's gem was
being transferred over to hers.  As she absorbed the
information, small
bits of information began to stand out causing her
curiosity to investigate.
What she found were the feelings which Tenchi harbored
deep within his
heart for her.  Experiencing the happiness she brought
him whenever she
was with him, plus the sadness he experienced in her
absence caused
her to weep as Tenchi held her throughout out the
entire ordeal.
Rocking her slowly in an attempt to calm her, Tenchi
said.  "Ryoko, I
wanted to tell you about the deal I had with Azusa
before the
engagement were to be announced.  Especially since I
wanted you to be
my wife.  Not my second wife as suggested by Lady
Funaho, but as my
first wife.  When you left the house crying I thought
about you all the time.
I also hated myself for causing you so much pain.
Seeing the grief in your
eyes was more than my heart could take because I knew
that it was I who
caused the pain.  Ryoko, I don't know if you can ever
forgive me."
Surprised by his statement, Ryoko turned around to
look at him as she
could only transfix on one portion of his statement.
"Y…You…you wanted to marry me?"
"Yes."
"T…Tenchi.  There is something I must tell you about
me."
"Is it anything about your past?"
"No."  Wanting to cry once more she held back the
tears as she continued
her statement.  "Tenchi.  I…I…I can't have any
children."
Tenchi stayed silent holding onto Ryoko as she began
to cry on his chest.
"Washu did a physical on me right after the incident
with Ayeka.  According
to her, you and I are not compatible.  I'm sorry
Tenchi, I know how much
you want to have a family."
"Ryoko if you are trying to push me away its not
working.  We already have
a family back on Earth.  We have Grandpa, dad,
Mihoshi, Ayeka, Sasami,
Mother Washu, and more especially we have each other."
"But…"
Putting a finger to her lips in an effort to silence
her, Tenchi loosens his hold
as he begins to stand up.  Surprised by his actions,
Ryoko quietly observes
Tenchi next movement as she sits on the edge of the
bed.  Grasping a hold
of her hand, Tenchi begins to kneel before Ryoko.
Causing her to gasp in
astonishment as she realizes what his intentions are.
"Ryoko, we have been close to one another since the
first time we had seen
each other by you’re cave.  We both experienced the
joy of childhood by
playing with one another in a fantasy world of demons
and samurais.  And we
both tried to comfort each other whenever one of us
was sad.   You are a part
of my life, one that I would never dream of replacing.
 I love you with all my
heart and soul.  And I would be honored if you would
accept me as your
husband.  Ryoko, will you marry me."
As tears of joy ran down Ryoko's cheeks, she replied.
"T…T…Tenchi.
Yes!!!  Yes, I'll marry you!"
As Tenchi began to stand up he brought Ryoko into a
gentle embrace where
he began to  give his future wife a passionate kiss.
"I love you Ryoko."
"I love you too Tenchi."

*********************************************************

The journey to Earth did take one day as Captain Lye
estimated giving the
newly engaged couple some time alone.  When they
arrived on Earth, both
the Empresses and Washu met Tenchi, Ryoko and Captain
Lye.  Not
wanting the rest of the families to know of their
arrival they were quickly
escorted into Washu's lab.  Once they had entered
through the portal
doorway Washu led Tenchi and Ryoko into one of her
examination rooms.
While in a separate room, the Captain stayed with the
Empresses and
briefed them on the orders given to him by the Emperor
and the treatment
of Ryoko while being held in Jurain custody.  Ryoko's
physical was
completed within a few minutes but the end result
puzzled Washu.  It took
her two hours to find out what the difference was
between this exam and
the one she did a few days ago.  When she found the
problem in her
equation, Washu wanted to kick herself for doing such
an elementary mistake.
How could she have forgotten to carry the one in that
particular step of the
equation?
<Well I might as well face the facts that even I the
greatest scientific genius in
the Universe can make such an easy mistake.  Now to
tell the families of these
new results, I wonder what each person's reaction will
be? >
"Is something wrong, Mother Washu?  You seem to be
preoccupied with
something."  Asked Tenchi as Washu led them to the
room where the other
party was.
"Hold that thought, Tenchi." Stated Washu as she
walked into the room and
sat down next to Lady Funaho and Misaki.
Whispering to them about the new results, both women
stared in shock at
Ryoko causing her to become nervous.
"What!?  What is it?  Is there something wrong with
me?"  asked Ryoko who
began to hold on to Tenchi's hand a bit tighter.
"There is nothing wrong with you Little Ryoko.  The
Empresses are just a bit
surprise about the results from your physical."
Stated Washu.
"I'll say!"  piped in Lady Misaki.
"Ditto." Replied Lady Funaho who smiled at both Tenchi
and Ryoko.
"Well, what is it that has everyone surprised."
Voiced Tenchi.
"A while back I performed a similar physical on Ryoko
and the final results
differed considerably from those of today's physical.
You are in perfect health
Ryoko, but due to a mistake on my part, I had given
you some incorrect
information."
"Washu, what are you trying to say." Uttered Ryoko as
the tension started
to get to her.
"What I am trying to say is that you and Tenchi can
have a baby and start a
family of your own whenever both of you are ready!"
replied Washu.
"What?" uttered Tenchi as he looked back and forth
between Ryoko and
Washu.
"A baby.  I can have a baby with Tenchi?"  voiced
Ryoko in a whisper like
voice.
"Yes my Little Ryoko." Replied Washu as tears began to
leave her eyes.
Overjoyed by the news Ryoko ran up to Washu and
embraced her as she
repeated saying, "Thank you mom."
Followed by Ladies Funaho and Misaki who were swept up
in the mood by
the scene of mother and daughter comforting one
another.

**********************************************************

Once the celebration had died down, the group left the
lab to announce the
arrival of Tenchi and Ryoko to the families.  As they
step out into the living
room Sasami was the first one to greet them.
"Tenchi, Ryoko you’re back!" cried the little princess
happily as she hugged
both of them.
"Lord Tenchi, you are safe." Voiced Ayeka behind her
sister.
"Tenchi, its good to have you back home safely my
son." Bawled Nobuyki.
"Welcome back Tenchi, Miss Ryoko."  Stated the two
guardians.
"We hope you are not mad at us Miss Ryoko.  We were
only following order."
Whispered the two.
"I'll talk to you guys later about that." Replied
Ryoko as her eyes turned red,
scaring the two floating logs.
"We are in for a world of hurt, Azaka."
"No need to tell me Kamadake."
"You!!!  You ruined all of my plans!" bellowed Emperor
Azusa as he pointed at
Tenchi.
"Azusa!"  Screamed Ladies Funaho and Misaki in
surprise to there husbands
outburst.
"Boy, you will learn what it means to cross my path.
Especially that space
wench of yours when I am through with you."
"Bring it on Azusa!" shouted Ryoko.
"I will not allow you to lay one hand on her as long
as I am around." Replied
Tenchi as he stepped in front of Ryoko.
"Enough!!!"  Shouted Yosho.  "I will not allow any
blood shed in my house.
If you are going to fight one another, take it
outside."
"Yosho, both you and your grandson are as of now
considered traitors to the
Jurain Empire for harboring and aiding in the release
of an assassin."
"That’s funny, I could have sworn you were the
assassin."  Stated Washu.
"I will personally deal with you later, Washu."
"Wait!"
"Quiet Funaho." Uttered the Emperor.
"Azusa!  Let my sister say what is on her mind if you
know what is good for
you."
"Ugh…Very well Misaki."
"Thank you sister." Said Lady Funaho as she bowed in
thanks to Lady Misaki.
"Now then Azusa, we have heard your version of the
incident in question. But
now I would like to hear Ryoko's if you don't mind."
"What is this!?  You, my own wife, would rather listen
to the lies to come from
the mouth of that slut!  Rather than believe those of
your own husband?"
"Azusa, I merely wish to hear her and see what she has
to say in her defense."
Replied Lady Funaho.
"Very well."  Uttered Emperor Azusa in frustration.

As Ryoko informed the families of the event in
question, Ayeka began to lower
her head in shame remembering how she stood by and did
nothing when Azusa
imprisoned her.  While Ryoko is mentioning the fact
that it was Ayeka whom ha
 started the fight instead of her, the tears began to
flow from the princess's eyes.
"Do you believe this nonsense.  Now she wants us to
believe that Ayeka is th
 guilty one." Retorted Azusa.
"Wait one moment Azusa.  There is still one more
witness who has yet to tell us
of the situation."  Mentioned Washu.
"Ayeka has already testified that what I said is the
truth."
"I was referring to Ryo-Ohki, not Ayeka."
"She can't even talk and the only ones who understand
what it is saying are you
and your daughter."
"True.  But I have a device which can replay actual
events for us from her
memories."
"You expect us to believe information you have placed
into one of your
devices as factual events?"
"Am I to understand that you are afraid that the
actual truth may come out."
Taunted Washu.
"Enough!  I am through listening to his crap.  Guards
arrest them!"  shouted
the Emperor as two dozen solders entered the house
with weapons in hand
and surrounded all parties inside the house.
"Take them outside!" remarked the Emperor as he
motioned the soldiers to
separate Funaho, Misaki, Ayeka, Sasami, and Mihoshi to
one side as they
stepped out of the house.
"Now to finish what I have started." Voiced Azusa as
he looked towards
Tenchi's group.
"Azusa what is the meaning of this!" yelled Lady
Misaki.
Ignoring her, the Emperor continued to instruct the
soldiers.  "All of you
men know what to do.  Eliminate them!" snarled Azusa
as he walked away
from the group.
"No!!!" yelled Sasami as she cried into her mothers
arms.
"Father, you said no one was going to be hurt."
"Quiet Ayeka!"
" You lied to me.  You said Ryoko was only going to be
locked up for a
few days so Tenchi and I could enjoy some time
together!"
"Ayeka! I said be quiet!!!" bellowed Azusa as he
slapped her.  Walking
away from her, he continued to say.  "It does not
matter what you have to
say anymore, the problem is being dealt with as we
speak."
"No father.  Don't do this." Cried Sasami.
"Enough of this.  Kill them all, now!!!"
As the soldiers fired on the group before them, Ayeka
and Sasami fainted
while the other three women stood in shock.
"Sir, we have a problem." Uttered the commander as he
pointed toward
the location of Tenchi's group.
"What do you…oh  crud." Stuttered the Emperor as he
looked at the
glowing orb which the commander was referring to.
Looking within the
surface of the sphere he was able to see that the
group whom the solders
fired on were safe.  Yelling at his men to fire once
more, Azusa began to
notice that his commands were falling on deaf ears as
his solders were
intrigued in what was before them.
As Tenchi released the shield protecting them,
whispers could be heard
within the ranks of the soldiers of the boy who can
yield the Light Hawk
Wings.
"What are you men standing around for.  Kill them!"
"But your majesty, the light hawk wings.  That boy…he
has the power."
Replied the commander in amazement.
"That does not matter.  All evidence and information
pertaining to this will
be erased from existence.  No one will know of the boy
or his power."
"I very much doubt that Azusa." Stated Washu with a
grin.  "You see, I
took several precautions incase you were to try
something like this."
"What could you possibly be talking about?" asked
Azusa.
"I took the liberty of placing several monitoring
devices around the area.
They have been able to record everything which has
happened since we
stepped outside of my lab."
"That makes no difference to me."
"Oh, did I forget to mention that they are also
televising all of this live
throughout all intergalactic broadcast stations."
Stated Washu with a smile.
Realizing that all his plans had been ruined, Azusa
decides to eliminate his
biggest threat alone.  While still embraced with the
power of the light hawk
wings, Tenchi uses tenhci-ken to block Azusa's attack.
 Not wanting to
harm their Emperor accidentally, the solders merely
stood by and hoped for
his safety.  Tenchi blocked each of Azusa's attacks as
he desperately tried
not to harm him.  Tired of looking like a fool in
front of his family and men,
Azusa did one final attack.  Holding the blade above
his head, he brought
the weapon down with all his might.  Realizing the
Emperors intent, Tenchi
deflected the on coming blade to his right and trusted
Tenchi-kens blade
upward into Azusa's chest.  As everyone gasped in
horror, Tenchi could feel
a part of the Jurain power leave Azusa's body.  When
Azusa's weapon
vanished from his hand the transfer of power was
complete.  Releasing
Azusa from the Tenchi-kens hold, Tenchi addresses the
man kneeling before
him.
"Azusa, for the misuse of your power as Emperor of
Jurai, Tsunami has
entrusted onto me the task of removing your Jurain
power.  You have been
allowed to retain the strength equal to that of a
normal Earth male.  As of this
moment on you will no longer be considered the Emperor
of Jurai.  Tsunami
has asked me to rule in your place until the people of
Jurai can construct a
system of government which can benefit all of its
citizens."
"You can't do this!" Bellowed Azusa.
"I am merely following Tsunami's instructions."
Replied Tenchi as he walked
away from him.
When Tenchi left Azusa lying on the ground weeping
like a baby, his family
immediately rushed to comfort him.  Tenchi on the
other hand was embraced
by Ryoko who immediately started to check him for any
injuries.

************************************************************

As the week progressed, the citizens and leaders of
planets with relations to
Jurai accepted the new Emperor.  While on Jurai itself
a small faction headed
by a couple of nobles attempted a coup in the hopes of
restoring Azusa as
Ruler.  But their attempt was in vain as the people of
Jurai defeated the faction
without any military help.  The people of Jurai were
intrigued about their new
Emperor and wanted to learn more about him.  That they
all watched their
television screens in anticipation as the wedding of
their Emperor was being
aired live.  They were especially eager to find out
whom he was going to marry
and be their new queen.
"Tenchi, do you take this woman to be your lawfully
wedded wife through
sickness and in health till death do you part?"  asked
Yosho who was doing a
western wedding this time around.
"Yes, I do."
"By the power invested in me.  I now pronounce you man
and wife or should I
say Emperor and Empress of Jurai.  You may now kiss
the bride."
As the happy couple kissed cheers were echoed
throughout space as everyone
wished good luck to them.
"Ladies and Gentlemen, it is my pleasure to present to
you the new Emperor and
Empress of Jurai, Tenchi and Ryoko Misaki."
