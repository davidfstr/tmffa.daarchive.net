                                The Edge
                           by Cyrus Marriner

	Ryoko fled.
	Often in her life, she had faced battles that would scare any 
sane being.  She had fought impossible odds, and beings of massive 
power.  And never had she fled.  This time, however, Ryoko couldn't 
face her adversary.  Up until now, her enemies had always been real, 
tangible opponents that she could defeat in ways she understood.  This 
time, this wasn't the case.  She was engulfed in sadness.  It was a 
powerful, impenetrable curtain that had surrounded her, and now she had 
no way out.
	She had felt it even before her suspicions had been confirmed.  
Tenchi had come to her and told her the truth.  Not brutally or mockingly, 
but kindly and sympathetically.  He had chosen Ayeka.  Ryoko didn't know 
what had happened, or why Tenchi had chosen her, but she knew that Ayeka 
had captured Tenchi's heart.
	Ryoko's first instinct was to destroy.
	It was an instinct that she had tried to keep away from the 
surface, one she tried to hide, one left over from her time with 
Kagato.  For a brief moment, after Tenchi spoke to her, Ryoko wanted to 
destroy him, Ayeka, and everything else.  She wanted to reduce the 
entire planet to an uninhabitable rock.  Such was the extent of her 
rage.  Then she saw the pain in Tenchi's face.  He was sad to have caused 
her so much pain.
	This was too much for Ryoko to comprehend.  She could not 
destroy, which was a response deeply ingrained into her psyche.  So she 
fled.  She ran from the pain's source, in hope that it would lessen, 
turning a deaf ear to Tenchi's stammering statements about how he still 
cared for her, how he didn't want to hurt her, and how he had only done 
this because he thought it would be less painful than to string her 
along.  All were true, but Ryoko did not hear because she did not want 
to hear.  She flew as fast as she could, until she arrived at Funaho.
	There, Ryoko wept.
	Tenchi had been her anchor.  Ever since she had left the 
imprisonment of the cave, Ryoko had needed Tenchi, her rock in a stormy 
sea.  That rock had just dissolved beneath her.  Her love was still 
there, but instead of a steady rock, it was a monstrous kraken, 
threatening to swallow her and destroy her.
	A myriad of thoughts entered her mind as she cried under the 
tree, none of them comforting.  She could never return, she felt.  She 
could never forget.  The pain was too much to bear, and it was all 
Ryoko could think about.  The depression threatened to overwhelm her 
unless she could find a way out.
	Ryoko created an energy blade in her hand.
	All she wanted was to end her pain, stop her conflict, cease her 
misery.  She wanted to completely remove the suffering she had 
experienced.  Her heart was filled with self-pity and veiled in self-
loathing.  She had not been good enough for Tenchi, and he had rejected 
her.  She was useless offal, waste product, as Kagato had called her so 
many times.
	Then she thought of Tenchi.  She had hurt him, as well.  She 
remembered the look on his face after he saw her reaction.  She hated 
herself for loving Tenchi, because all her love had caused him was 
pain.  And there was one thing Ryoko would never do.  She would never 
hurt Tenchi.
	Ryoko's blade hovered over her throat.
	She saw her life before her, spread out like so many puzzle 
pieces jammed together in incongruous patterns and colors.  She saw the 
brightness in front of her, a brightness generated by Tenchi, fade 
away, and his piece of the puzzle slowly disintegrated.  She wanted to 
end it, and she could, with one thrust.
	Then she saw Sasami.  The young princess's smiling visage, which 
was almost never marred by sadness.  She saw Sasami crying.  She saw 
Sasami mourning for her.  She saw Sasami hurt, in pain.
	Ryoko dispelled the blade.
	Her sadness was there, and it was not at all alleviated.  She 
felt as bad as she had before, but she could not end her life.  She 
could not hurt Sasami.  Then she understood.  Sasami cared for her.  
Ryoko had never felt cared for.  Then she continued to see.  Tenchi 
cared, Washu cared, Mihoshi cared.  Even Ayeka cared.  She knew this 
because she cared for all of them too.
	Ryoko could not end her life because of the people who cared for 
her.  She may have had no future in her eyes because of her loss of 
Tenchi, but she could not end her life.  It was not because she had a 
fear of death, but because she was compassionate.  She was too 
compassionate to kill herself, because of the others it would hurt.  
Perhaps it was not the best reason to keep on going, but it was 
certainly a reason.  And it kept her alive until she could find her own 
reasons.
	Ryoko stood and walked back towards the house.
	Ryoko began to think of the freckled girl with bright pink eyes 
who had saved her from death.  She had developed a true fondness for 
the girl.  Perhaps she could renounce her royalty and become a space 
pirate with Ryoko.  The thought of the young girl dressed as a space 
pirate caused Ryoko a slight chuckle.
	The idea was a dream, of course.  Ryoko knew that it would never 
happen.  But still, it was a pleasant fantasy, and one that made Ryoko 
feel better.  Perhaps she could still hope, and still live.  She had a 
dream, nonsensical as it was, but it would keep her going until she 
found her true purpose.
	Ryoko saw the house.
	She approached the house, wiped her eyes, and attempted to retain 
her composure.  She felt stronger now, no longer the weak, empty shell 
that had fled from Tenchi's bedroom.  She had people who cared for her, 
people who loved her, and she had dreams.  Of course, she had to have 
dreams.  After all, what is life but an ceaseless chase after one's 
dreams?
	Ryoko knew she could handle this.  She would talk to someone, 
possibly Washu, and try to sort herself out.  She needed to heal 
herself, for everyone's sakes.  She would also need to talk to Tenchi.  
Although he could not be her love, he could still be her rock.
	Ryoko smiled.  Although all was not perfect now, she knew it 
could be, and that gave her the courage to enter the house.

Thanks for reading.  This story was just an idea that came to me one
night, and I wrote it all down in one sitting.  Thanks goes to
Hospitaller, for proofreading, and SC_ for her feedback.  Ryoko's
thoughts are closely based on my own battles with depression, so
there's a lot of me in this story.  Please give me some feedback at
