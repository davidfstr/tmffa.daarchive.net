Chapter: Tenchi Reunion 2

Disclaimer: Do not own Tenchi if I did believe me I wouln't be doing this
I'd be paying someone else to do it.
 **
It was late evening before Tenchi decided to go home, he had been working
late that day trying to get the last vegetables before the winter set in.
Passing under the remaining cherry blossoms on a tree he remembered when he
fought with Kagato on the planet Juri.

When he returned he found Ryoko waiting for him under the cherry
blossoms.Her soft words still sang like birds awakening from a winter sleep.
"I'll tell you something my Tenchi,the carnival comes and
goes............... if you wait for a while.......it will always come back
to you."

Tenchi smiled at the thought.
"She was right they're all coming back."

"Your royal highness, Sasami, we will be in planet zone 7026A7B in less than
8 minutes, exactly 5."
"Hours 41 seconds." The second queen of Juri finished for the log with a
purple mark across the front.
"Prepare for model 34B transmission, I am going to check on Tsunami."
"Yes Ma'am" the oversized log chimed in.
**
Sasami took on the form of Tsunami and in so developed her mind and body.
She had a lovely young girl whom she named Tsunami.
Tsunami brushed her silver hair which hung to the floor almost touching it
in front of her vanity mirror.
The door to the rather large room spread apart revealing her mothers
shining face.

Tsunami straightened up immediately.
"Hello mommy, and what brings you to this part of the ship." She said this
with a giggle.
Sasami had to admit the ship was large enough to be a colony ,so she
understood her daughters joke.
"Just checking on you."
Sasami sat down on the large bed. Tsunami moved to sit by her mother ,
and secretly gave her a glance.
"Mother?"
"Yes,Treeflower?"
Noticing her pet name Tsunami loosened up.
"Tell me more about Earch,please."
Tsunami laughed at her daughters mispronunciation. At her age she probably
would have said the same thing.
"Well, for starters its Earth not Earch..............Earth is a place much
like Juri except that it doesn't respect tree's as much as we do.The Earth
has beautiful mountains that reach as far as the eye can see,like giants
watching over the world. Their water is as clear as your eyes.
                       In the fall the leaves turn colors. So many colors
you would lose count if you tried to number them. In winter snow covers the
ground in a blanket of ice covering the grass from the sun's rays.


Tsunami stared at the wall while fantasies of the Earth tripped through her
mind like waltzing dinner guests.
"It sounds so beautiful, I wish I could see it."

"You can, and you will." Sasami looked out the wide window which led to the
outside world of space.
**
On the steps of the Masaki shrine sat a boy who looked to be about 14 he
awaited patiently for his Great-grandfather to come and train with him.

"Gosh, this is the most boring thing I've ever done."
The young man looked at his watch.
"An hour, 1 hour I've been sitting here waiting for that old man."
Suddenly, without warning a wooden bokken came flying out of the trees.
~*SMACK*~
The bokked hit him right in the back of the head.
"Ow, My God why don't you just kill me for crying out loud."

"You should have dodged that, Keigi." An old man now stepped out of the
shadows beneath a tree.
"That was sneaky, but are you ready for this!"
At that Keigi jumped in the air and brought down his bokken that he had been
holding so lamely upon his Great-grandfather with the power he could muster
at that time.
**
Tenchi walked out of the bathroom from taking a shower.
'
With a towel draped around his shoulders he paused for a moment to look at a
worn picture. The picture had seen better days but still remained in tact.
The picture was of a woman with pale blue eyes and light purple hair.
Her smile seemed to make the fact that it was raining in the picture less
noticeable.Her kimono was blue with white flowers on it, and in her arms she
held a baby.
At the bottom of the photograph words were written in red ink.
Moriya with Keigi.
The words seemed to stab at Tenchi's heart.
Moriya was Tenchi's (arranged) marriage. 15 years ago his father Nobyuki
lost a bet with an associate at work and so in losing this bet his son had
to marry the associate's first daughter.
They spent time together and eventually fell deeply in love and got married.
Within a year a son was born to them. The baby was perfect except for one
thing his eyes.
They were strange and yet beautiful. One was a colbat blue while the other
was dark purple with a hint of green.
Nevertheless Moriya felt so attached to the baby. One dark day Moriya fell
ill and became bedridden for quite a long time.But, try as it might the
sickness could not keep her from spending her last year on the Earth with
her lover and child. Keigi was six when she died.
It was like the world had spat on him and cast him in the darkness.
Tenchi had lost the people that meant the most to him.
****
The reason the girls left was unclear for almost  three years. It was
because they were tricked into thinking that he would never choose it was
like a never-ending battle full of pain and suffering.While it had been fun
at times it was turning out to be nothing more than a game. A game played
with no results....no winner.

"I swear the vascostacy of that chemical is to unstable to use as a portal."
Two people were standing in the middle of what seemed to be a huge lab. One
had reddish pink hair.One had orange hair. They were arguing profusely.
"But, mother the chemical frinhyugate isn't conpadable to the radius of a
square times pi.And as you must know the chemical that was made from that
equation was about as right as Hullzoars illusion of the 465,639,013 planet
of this solar system."

"Look Tashu, who is the grown up woman and who is the 13 year old who can't
even make up her mind about what to wear to the Tenchi Reunion?"
"If you were in your child form, mommy Washu, I would say you!"

The orange haired girl turned to walk into the elevator leading to the
second floor of the lab. The elevator had clear brass walls . She stepped
in, and pressed the button for second floor. Before the doors closed she
yelled out of her mother.
"Pi equals the viscosity of sixty times sixty point five!!"

Washu poured a green liquid into a orange,black, and red mixture. It took
about five seconds for Tashu to get to the next floor, and put on a helmet.
KKKKAAAABBOOOOOOOOMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The sound of breaking glass, furniture, and computers could be heard.
Taisho darted under a desk as the rubble began to fall.

Keigi came down on his grandfather with the bokken.Just when he was about to
swing his grandfather pulled another sword and stabbed out.Keigi was so far
in the air he landed on the sword his grandfather stabbed with. Moving fast
Keigi did a backflip off the sword and landed a good three feet away.
"I'll say this, Keigi, your better in close combat then your father was."
Keigi got out of his fighting stance.
"Really."
"No, not really I was just trying to divert your attention."
"What?"
~*BONK*~
He hit Keigi in the left shin bone,then went for the other.But he was
stopped by Keigi pulling a dagger out and blocking it.
"Good, your learning boy."

After two hours of training the two retired back to the house for some tea.
Keigi and his father sat outside on the porch to drink their tea."You know
that some of my old friends are going to be coming for a visit in two days."
"Yeah, I know.You told me they were all women and their daughters and mabey
some sons if I'm lucky."
"So tell me about the women." Keigi said through sips.
"huh?" A surprised tenchi sputtered.
"Tell me what they look like."  "Oh,well lets see."Tenchi thought about it.
It had been at least fifteen years since he'd seen them. " Hey I know I
could show you." Tenchi got up from the porch slide the door open and walked
inside. About a moment later he came back with a photograph in his hand. He
calmly handed it to Keigi. Keigi's eyes ran quickly over the smooth paper in
his hand. His eyes darted to each girl examined her facial features until
one in particular caught his eye. "Who is this?" He moved the photograph in
Tenchi direction and pointed to a woman with catlike eyes and cyan hair.
"That is Ryoko Hakubi.Why do you ask?" Now it was Keigi's turn to run into
the house onto the second floor where his room lie. He reached under his bed
and felt around carefully
until he felt smooth paper like a magazine.
He ran down the stairs to see that his father had moved inside and now was
looking at the picture longingly. Keigi somewhat interrupted his thoughts.
"I found what I was looking for." He sat next to Tenchi and opened the
magazine to page forty-seven. Tenchi only glanced but thought the cover's
tittle was The Bounty Hunter Guide. He stopped pondering why his son had a
magazine about bounty heads when he saw the story on the page. He let a
small gasp escape his lips.

       Tenchi was at a loss for words he couldn't believe it. It was all to
strange.

Meanwhile...............
On a planet in the gardania galaxy two hooded women walk into a bar.They
remove their hoods which is a custom in this galaxy.One orders a drink while
other stays silent.
      Over at another table a guy with green hair and muscular build stares
at the two along with his four other buddies.  The bartender poured the red
liquid into a long handle wineglass and served it to one of the mysterious
women. When the woman looks up to pay for her drink the bartender gasps.
"Your...its you.......your."
The women downs her drink in one gulp and looks up at the frightened guy.
In a low tone almost a growl the woman says"Ryoko, is that the name your
looking for?"
"No Ma'am........I mean."
The 1st women who reveled herself as Ryoko looks at the other girl.
"Pay and give the gentleman here a nice tip."She puts her hood back on and
walks towards the door. The other girl lays the money out in nice dollar
bills. Before the bartender could scoop up the money her hand wen't over
it."Now for the tip.........we were never here got that?"Her tone of voice
made the guy fell really quezsy. "No problem Ma'am."
                        The two walked in silence. A dark allyway lay before
them they were about halfway down the ally when two guys steped out in
frount and behind them. The green haired guy made himself known in presence.
"Hello ladies I'm Baka and I'll be takeing all your money now."
For the first time the 2end girl spoke.
"Were you aware that your name means idiot?"

"Oh we have a scoholar here don't we."He turned to the other guys and
laughed loudly.
They inturn bellowed like animals.
This time she spoke to Ryoko. "Sumone Ryo-oki now, we're going to need a
quick getaway."  "Alright then."

The guys were laughing still.They stopped for the moment and started to
advance toward them in  a quickening pace like they'd break into a run at
any moment.
All four men were in a circle around her. In what light was there the glint
ofa dagger could be seen.
It took just that. In a movement that was to quick to see by human eyes, she
threw her cloak in the air. All the men (stupidly)looked up. From under her
cloak came the glint of a sythe ina complete circle she turned. The only
sound that could be heard was the gentle swoosh of the sythe.She put her
hand in the air and caught her cloak. All fell except the woman.

The sky turned dark green as was the scenary when it was night on juno.
Ryuuko looked to the sky.
Miya miya may mi(now ryuuko we must leave).
Ryuuko put the sythe in her cloak, and teleported to Ryo-oki. "Mother, shall
we leave for the Tenchi Reunion now? If we go now we can make it in two
days."
Ryoko stood at the bridge of Ryo-oki.  "Why?"
Ryuuko thought but could not think of anything.Except.
"Mother."
"Yes,Ryuuko?"
"Because its all about the journey, not the outcome."
(silence)
"Your right." Ryoko pushed her fist in the air "Yeah lets go!"
