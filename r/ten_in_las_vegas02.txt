Tenchi in Las Vegas - Chapter 2 : "Jackpot"

 
Disclaimer: Hi, I have to tell you I don't own any characters but Braden. The
others belong to AIC and Pioneer. I don't own the hotels either. No, I really
don't own many of the people, but that makes it less boring.
 
[At Braden's house in Henderson, Nevada, everyone has woke up]
 
Tenchi: This was a good idea.
 
Braden: I think so to.
 
Ayeka: How can you afford this house, you're the common man.
 
Braden: It gets hard when you own 2 stores in major cities to go broke.
 
Ayeka: How did you do that?
 
Braden: One I worked my way up, the other I was vice president and the
other guy moved.    

Ayeka: But you moved to.
 
Braden: Ayeka, we didn't have something back in 1988.
 
Ayeka: What?
 
Braden: The internet.
 
Ayeka: Jurai has had it for 1000 years, don't say it hasn't been around.
 
Braden: Earth has only had it for 12 years, we aren't as advanced.
 
Ayeka: Oh yeah.
 
Tenchi: So you run the stores on the internet?
 
Braden: Yes. Why, do you want to make my stock crash?
 
Tenchi: No.
 
Braden: I was just kidding.
 
Tenchi: Good
******************************************************************
[At the Luxor]
 
Tenchi: So this is that one pyramid.
 
Braden: Yes, it doesn't use elevators.
 
Tenchi: What does it use?
 
Braden: Vertical elevators.
 
Tenchi: I see now.
 
Ayeka: I'm going to go.......find something more than that sinful gambling.
 
Braden: Really.
 
Ayeka: Yes, really.
 
(Ayeka walks off)
 
Braden: (looks on to where Ayeka went and back to the others) She's going
to gamble.
 
Ryoko: That's what I'm going to do.
 
(everyone walks off to go on to what they want oh, and don't worry, Sasami
and Mihoshi
are back at the house)
*******************************************************************
 [At any various area where there are slot machines]
 
Ayeka: Which one do I go to.................. Big jackpot, this one.
 
[In the same area Ryoko sits next to Ayeka]
 
Ayeka: Yes I won.........................(looks at Ryoko) I WAS HELD AT
GUNPOINT.
 
Ryoko: With all these cameras.
 
Ayeka: Uh, YES.
 
(Braden steps in)
 
Braden: So gambling is really sinful? What else is sinful to you? 
 
Ayeka: Please don't tell my father.
 
Braden: I still don't fell like talking to him. But this is Las Vegas, here there
are no rules.
 
Ayeka: So I can speed?
 
Braden: I said rules, not laws.
 
Authors Notes: The next ones will be longer, look for them.
