ch.1
A friend in need.

******************************************************************


A bright explosion lit up the sky, filling it with thousands of burning 
pieces of metal. The
ship had been totally incinerated by the blast. Mihoshe lay just outside the 
perimeter
when she saw the blast. A freighter she and her subbordinates were escorting 
went up
after the initial explosion.

"Officer Mihoshe what should we do?"
screamed one of her men.

"I'll take a route outside the perimiter you follow, set a heading of mark 2 
niner"

A scout ship pulled out in front of the small patrol.

"I can't let you go any further, the servents of jun bar are now in complete 
control of
this space"

"you dogs! this galaxy police jusristiction!"
yelled one of the officers.

"if you continue in this futile pursuit then we will be forced to take 
action!"
yelled another one of the officers

"Ha, I know how you opperate! You wont lift a finger until you know that 
this wont be a
galactic incident!"

"This is officer Mihoshi If you continue these terroristic threats then the 
galaxy police will
be forced to take action"

Another explosion-another blast obliterated a ship just next to mihoshi's.

"this is officer nanko of the 56th precinct-you have commited acts of war 
against this
department wich will not be taken lightly. You are under arrest!"

another explosion this time from mihoshi's ship, it vaporized one of her 
left engines
throwing debri into the outlying area. Mihoshi could be heard screaming 
while her ship
drifted into space.

*******

"You take one more step and I'll suspend you from all police activity!"

"Damnit, my partner is out there, and I will not sit here waiting for her to 
die and show
up in the god damned mortuaires!"

"Dont you think I know that! This whole department's been on alert since 
this morning.
Believe me we're all doing what we can to locate private Mihoshi...... the 
thing is, since
Mihoshi neglected to wear her cube and we cant get a real idea of where her 
ship is
stranded"

"Dont give me that bull! You know every ship has at least two rescue beacons 
that are
activated when a pilot doesnt respond to the controlls, you know it!"

"Yes officer Kiyone, but we have reason to believe that she has beencaught 
in a lunar
eclipse behind one of the moons of jupiter"

"Radio Silence? How do you know she isnt already dead?"

"We dont, we're counting on a single witness report."

"What! Thats bullshit! Let me see this witness"

"sorry but she is still in police custody"

"She? I want to seee this witness"

"Im sorry but the witness is still being questioned"

"I dont care I have the right to know!"

"Ms Kiyone if you leave this room you will be permanently removed from the 
galaxy
police"

"excuse me Chief officer Dody, you can take my badge and stick it up your 
ass"

"Now see here Kiyone, I have complete controll over this entire 
juristiction. If you
leave now I will have you arrested for insubordination!"

"I dont think you heard me Dody, but I am no longer a galaxy police police 
officer"

Kiyone stormed out of the room throwing her hard earned badge to the floor, 
thinking
to herself about what she had just done.

"i have always dreamed of being a police officer And for what-to eventually 
quit
and die in a desperate attempt to find my partner"
scouled kiyone

"damnit, if your not dead Mihoshe, I'll kill you myself"

*******

"Tenchi!"

came a familiar voice

"tenchi, come here I have to show you something"

"What is it Sasami?"

"Tenchi there's a space ship, and its headed toward us!"

A bright gleam lit up the sky as the small ship pierced the atmosphere. It 
splashed
down in the lake in front of the Masaki house.

"Grandpa, come quick I mite nead your help!"

"what is it tenchi?" asked yosho (couldnt remember earth name, so sue me)

"Grandpa there's an unfamiliar ship in front of our house----again"

"Tenchi maybe its Mihoshe, or Kiyone!"

"Lets go see Sasami" yelled Tenchi.

*******

"Nanako, Shinshi, Naynay, Kayatome, sazaki, commander, anyone!"
(ran out of wierd names)

yelled mihoshi.

" are all my friends really dead? They cant be they just cant be!"

suddenly a crackle came in from the radio, it was nanako-and her ship!

"hello is anyone out there? am i the only survivor?" yelled nanako

"Nanako do you read me?"

asked mihoshi

"request immediate medical assistance I'm wounded and could be bleeding 
internally,
my ships computer is down and I cant contact headquarters"

"Mihoshi is it really you? I cant believe it I thougt I was the only 
survivor"

"Nanako, listen carfeully I need you to transfer all of your ships data to 
mine my ship
has a better chance of reaching headquarters then yours does"

"Yes mam!"

The two met on board in disbelief, thinking of eachother they both rushed to 
treat
each other's wounds. Mihoshi was the most seriosly injured,
suffering from internal injurries.  they decided to sit down for the time 
being.




The two talked while assesing each other-past
life, future, family. Their converstation seemed to linger on for hours.

"Mihoshi I have to ask you a personal question"

"yes?"

muttered mihoshi

"have you ever wondered why you went through the training at the accademy?"

"what do you mean? I have never regreted my trianing or the time I spent at 
the
academy"

"I was just asking, I've always thought of you as my hero... and well have 
always
thought of you as being, well..."

"what?"

"a little less ditsy then what everybody's been saying about you"

*******

back on earth.......


"Tenchi I'm scared!"

The foreign ship landed in their lake causing a great wave of water to be 
swept over
the masaki house. Out of the ship came a young women from the galaxy police 
shouting
for immediate help.

"Hello there, I need help and quick"
yelled the young officer "Sure whats the problem?"

"my friend has been seriously wounded, she needs immediate medical 
attention"

Tenchi ran over to the ship and carried out a young female under a large 
blanket.

"Excuse me but is your ship still able to fly?"

asked sasami

"No, the engines were damaged in a fire fight, thats why I had to land here"

said the women Tenchi, and the others helped carry the two women inside. 
Ryoko had
awakened from her nap when she heard the loud splash.

"hey whats up?"

asked ryoko

"This woman's ship crash landed here and we're helping her friend"

said sasami

"does kyone need any really special attention?"

asked ryoko "what do you mean that isn't.....

" tenchi stopped himself to look at the woman under the blanket.

"oh my god, Kiyone!"

yelled tenchi

"you know her?"

asked the woman

"yes thats my friend Kiyone of the galaxy police, why is she like this, what 
happened?"

asked tenchi

"Kiyone surrendered her badge to look for Mihoshi, but when the commander 
denied
her safe leave she stole one of the patrol ships"

"and they shot her down for that?"

asked ryoko

"no, she returned back to headquarters and tried to get me and a small group 
of officers
to come with her. I agreed, but the others didn't and alerted the commander. 
When Kiyone
fled, the guards shot at her. She was hit bad and I carried her to the space 
dock. One
of the guards cruisers pursed us until we reached this solar system. My ship 
was badly
damaged and I had to crash land here"

"Kiyone did all that?"

asked sasami

"I'm afraid so"

said the women

"excuse me, but I didn't quite catch your name, Ms.-"

"Naomi"

"naomi, hmm that sounds familiar, have you been on the news lately?"

"Sir the chase has probably been broadcast throughout the galaxy, believe me 
I know
how the galaxy police work"

*******

"nanako come here quick! I think I'm bleeding!"

Mihoshi had been injured quite badly and was bleeding internally. Nanako had 
to get her
to a doctor.


End of ch.1


Wierd ending huh? i'll work on it and check for spelling thanks for reading 
ch.1 go on to
ch.2 below.








******************************************************************


ch.2 Mihoshi where are you?



"Mihoshi hold on-"
yelled nanako

mihoshi had gone into and out of shockover the past hour or so and didn't 
seem to
be improving.  The poor woman finally stabalized and was able to talk to 
nanako.

"nanako are you....you going to make it?"
said mihoshi in a jesting manner.

"shut up you, dont waste your energy"

"I was just....."

Mihoshi toppled over.

"mihoshi!"

*******

"How's kiyone?"
asked tenchi

"she should have been done regenerating by now-" said washu "I'll have to 
look into it"

The day had gone by just like the other six. Everyone would stand around 
kiyone's
regenerating pod hoping that kiyone would soon awaken.

"Naomi, what made you decide to help kiyone anyway?" asked ryoko

"well i dont know, i had just gotten back from a patrol when i see miss 
kiyone running
with a flock of her fellow officers behind her. she was dragging and officer 
behind her
that volunteered to help her, but he was shot and captured. I yelled to her 
asking what
the matter was when she just grabbed my arm and therw me into the cockpit of 
one
of the ships in the dock.

"interesting story"
said ryoko

"hey everyone kiyone has finally woke up!"
yelled sasami

there was a mad rush to washu's regeneration chamber

"kiyone how do you feel!?"
asked an eager sasami

"who are you little girl and where's your mom?"
said kiyone

"kiyone dont you know where you are? Do you remember anything at all?"

"who's kiyone and who are all of you?"
said the confused women

"I was afraid of this" said washu

"what, what happened?" asked tenchi

"i'm afraid she has amnesia, so far my reasearch hasn't covered mental 
states of
rehabilatation, and it will take me a while to reasearch this condition." 
said washu
"Tenchi you need to help kiyone get her memory back"

"wa wa wa what!? why me? " stambered tenchi

"well, mihoshi isnt here and this seems like the best ticket to full 
recovery, and
becides i didnt say it couldn't be a group effort now did i?"

"excuse me but could someone please tell me where i am? and who this Kiyone 
is?"

ayeka walked over to the cot and sat down next to kiyone

"miss , your name is kiyone please remember."

"I cant remember-its all just a blur to me" kiyone said with tears in her 
eyes.

Then ryoko stepped up "Now Kiyone dont tell me you cant remember me, im the
most wanted criminal in the universe-remember?"

clear frustration could be seen on the former gp officer, trying to pull the 
memories
back to try to remember. "im sorry everyone but you all just seem like 
strangers to
me-if you could, would you mind introducing yourselves to me?"

"*sure*"


*******

"mihsohi, mihsohi, wake up! please i need you to tell me what to do"
screamed nanako

The ship had gone into orbit around jupiter and was being pulled into its 
atmosphere.

"mihoshi, mihoshi, please god damnit wake up!" screamed nanako again

suddenly mihoshi sat up, her eyes stared into space again and looked like 
she was
about to leave conciosness again.

"thank god-mihoshi i need you to tell what to do-yagami's controls are 
totally
differn't from my ship's"

"i cant feel my legs, your going to have to drag me over to the console" 
said mihoshi

The ship started to shake, then twist throwing both of the women to the 
wall.
Mihoshi uttered a few words to nanako:

"to reactive the auto pilot push the two buttons on the console to the right 
marked............."

"MARKED WHAT!? MARKED WHAT!?" yelled nanako

In a last ditch effort she jammed every button on the console, 
hoping........

*******

back at the masaki house hold...

"Well kiyone I'm Washuu, this is Tenchi, Aeyeka, Sasami, Nobuyuki, Yosho, 
Ryoko,
Naomi.....Your Partner, and that furry little Rabit thing is our cabbit(hate 
that name-cabbit
cat rabbit, stupid)".

"Thankyou everyone its very nice to meet you all, again. Ill make sure I get 
reauainted with
you all again".


___________________________________________________________________________
			stop no more no more!

ok the amnesia thing was a good idea at the time but it just drags on and 
on! and as for
the stupid mihoshi nanko thing-thats officially written off into a happy 
ending. Sorry if you
liked it (yeah right) instead of continuing with that extremely pathetic 
storline Im going to
revamp the whole thing-, lets say perhaps kiyone is being held at gunpoint 
as a hostage
onboard yagami and mihoshi is the negotiator.(dont worry it gets better i 
sware it)
___________________________________________________________________________


"hey now dont do anything stupid alright (this comming from mihoshi herself) 
lets just be calm
ok?"

"no you damn gp keep gettin in my way, so im gonna blast ya both to make an 
example for the
rest of the gp and your damned #1 academy"

"listen if you want to get even with the galaxy police then this just isnt 
the way, youve got my
partner in a hostage position so that automatically makes you armed and 
dangerous, plus you
my partner a nasty bonk on the head wich can also be made out as an assault 
charge, and
i bet you didnt even think of the small crimes you have committed." said 
mihoshi

"small crimes?" said the criminal

"yes small crimes-unholstered weapon, disorderly conduct, indescent 
exposure, GRAFFITTI!, I
should take you hostage for what you did to the outside of our ship!"

mihoshi looked she was about to cry dropping to her knees and holstering her 
weapon

"do you know how long it took me to paint this ship!? it took 2 
years-2years! and now i have
to give a complete scrub down"

the crazed man found this a perfect time to recieve his next hostage. 
holding kiyone in a head
lock he lunged for mihoshi.

(lets try mihoshi's point of view)

>it took me forever to actually paint the ship, i started painting even 
>before kiyone was assigned
to me<

"errrrrrrr your going to pay for this!"

mihoshi finally snapped out of it pulled her gun from her holster. the man 
made a dive for her
but mihoshi got a shot off  just before he touched her. it all seemed to 
happen in slow
motion- the mysterious man holding kiyone, mihoshi holding her standard 
issue and then-pow.
it was all over. the man dropped to the floor exposing what he really was-a 
galaxy police officer
kiyone stood there with a blank look on her face while mihoshi holstered her 
weapon.

"come on kiyone lets report this to headquarters-im sure theres more just 
like him-kiyone?"

kiyone just kept starring straight ahead with the blank look on her face. 
she clutched her hand
to her side in one of her regular poses, a smile ran across her face then 
she collapsed revealing
her wound.

"oh my god kiyone im sorry i didn-

"dont worry mihoshi its not your fault besides look at it this way- youll 
get a huge promotion
for this"

"no not for this not this way! youll die"


______________________________________________________________________

alright here we go again the story still in the same crappy mood- 
depressingly happy this fic
has taken a turn for the worst oh well i just let it run through and see 
what happens
_______________________________________________________________________


"i wont die ill just sort of fade away"muttered kiyone

"what kind of partner, what kind of friend are you leaving me behind like 
this?" argued mihoshi

"dont worry ill be there with you all the time.............................. 
*gasp* *cough*"
