Lost soul's: act 1: The wish



(p.s. the<> and ^^ are thinking things)



"laugh with me,
and walk with me
the long, long way.
Tarry with me,
My love, at my side.
"twist and twine
your days with mine,
Cling close and never part.
Twist and twine 
Your life with mine"

Ryoko read these words out-loud from an old looking book and looked 
down and began to cry. For she knew these where the official marriage 
words of the jurai people, once you said these to each other your bound 
for life. How she wished she and Tenchi could be wed <he love's Aeka, 
and one of these day's he will say so>
 ^He does not now will you shut up! ^ 
<You know he does, he waiting for you to tell him how you feel and 
he'll say "but I love Aeka so">
 ^You're a $^@#%! ^ 
<Oh am I? Well that mean's you are too then>
  ^Shut up ya old hag! ^ 
<@%$@$*$@&^*> She looked up, a shooting star fell across the deep black 
sky she closed her eye's and remembered one time then she was little, 
Washu, her mother, told her
 "When you see a shooting star, make a wish and it'll come true, but 
you must send it off with a kiss" 
^Well, she's never lied before^ so she whispered
 "Please make Tenchi mine, just for one night, then he may do as he 
pleases" she put her hand, now ice cold from the night, to her lip's 
and blew a kiss
"Ryoko?" she heard tenchi behind her
"Hello Tenchi" she put her head back down as he slid down to the bolder 
she was siting on, al most falling in the lake below  
"Why are you crying?" he wiped the now sticky check of Ryoko and picked 
up her hand's
 "Your hand's are cold" he put them to his lips, hands cup around hers, 
and blew warm air
 "Better?"
 "Yes" her check's where now sticky AND pink
 <Yep, he hates you>
 ^Oh shut up ya @&$*#, he does love US^
 <.> Ryoko looked back down, she felt like crying again, but she would 
wait, she had to know 
"Tenchi?"
 "Yeah?"
 "If you had to pick, would you pick Aeka?" Tenchi picked her head up 
in is hand and looked her in the eye's 
<Yep, here's it come's> 
^Would you please SHUT UP! ^
 "No" he said in a soft but deep voice. He put his lips to her ear
 "I love you" when pulled back he saw tear's in her eyes as she gave a 
small smile 
"I love you too" he kissed her slowly and laid her on to the bolder. 
"Im not sure if this is right here or on jurai, but I don't care" he 
said as he slipped her blouse off -
<I'm board.I know! I'll bug lord Tenchi!> Aeka thought as she got up 
from the desk in her room and walk the little way from her room to 
Tenchi's "LORD TENCHI!!!!!" she called out into the darkness "oh, Its 
too dark" she turned on the light and looked out the window "huh?" Aeka 
said as she watched Tenchi walk across the lawn ^hum, I think I'll 
fallow him> so she walk as quietly as she could out the door and across 
the lawn "ill just go to the hill over the lake, you can see everything 
from there" so she went there and looked over the edge "T-Tenchi."she 
said as she saw Tenchi kiss Ryoko "I.I.I have too stop them. Now. I 
don't know how, but I will" she stormed back to the house - Tenchi woke 
up and looked over his shoulder
 "Morning my love" he rolled over and hugged Ryoko 
"Morning"
 "Sleep well?"
 "I did with you by my side."
 <Its morning, he still loves us, it wasn't the wish. > 
^I told you. ^ 
"We should go home, the other's will worry" Tenchi said as he slipped 
his close back on 
"I guess your right" Ryoko said as she two put her thing's back on.

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

 "What where you doing all night anyway?" Tenchi asked on they're way 
back 
"Watching you sleep"
 "I love you" he replied with a smile 
"I love you too". 
(10 minute's later at the house)
 "Maybe we shouldn't tell any one" Ryoko said, feeling that if they 
knew something very bad would happen, and her feeling's where always 
right
 "Maybe your right"
 "We should go in alone, ill go to the roof, as though I've been there 
all night, and you can go in and say you stayed at a friend's"
 He nodded
 "And tonight, you'll come to my bedroom and we'll relive last night" 
he said as he kissed her and walked in the house 
<That boy has more of a wild side then us>. 

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Tenchi walked in the house without a word more to Ryoko
 < Finely, she's all mine>  
^Life is so good^ 
"Tenchi!" Sasami ran to him "wear where you???" 
"Clam down, I was with a friend all night, nothing to worry about" 
Sasami frowned 
"Ok then, want some breakfast?"
 "Yeah, thanks"
 "Oh and Tenchi?" 
"Yeah?" 
"Do you know where Ryoko is?"
 "Nope" Tenchi tried to say it as un-I-know-but-im-not-gonna-tell-you 
as he could
 "Humm, well, do you want pancakes or waffles?" "pancakes"(ummm, my 
fav!). and so he went on with the day as though nothing happened.

***********************************************************************
******** 

Ryoko walked(ok, flew) into breakfast  with a blank look on her face. 
Only the girl's where there 
"Where's Tenchi?" she asked 
"Tenchi left already Ryoko, want some breakfast?" Sasami said/asked in 
her sweet voice 
"Yes please" Ryoko said as she sat down and help her self to some food 
(egg rice, pancakes, waffles) and ate (believe it or not) with 
uttermost manner's
 "Your acting strange today" Aeka said, not looking from her food "am 
I?" Ryoko murmured  
"You have been weird all morning" Keyione said 
"I guess im just tiered" Ryoko said as she walked out.


The next week went by the same, till they got some news from Tenchi's 
collage. 
"You have to go where for a how long?!?!?!?!?" Aeka asked in horror 
"the U.S., they say ill be there till x-miss" Tenchi answered 
"Just say no, please tenchi, we need you here" Ryoko said 
"I cant, if I don't I cant get my degree"
 "But Tenchi, ill miss you" Sasami grabbed his arm and hugged it 
 "I miss you too, but ill be home soon, I promise" he patted her head 
softly 
"Very well Tenchi, if it must be so" Ryoko sighed and went through the 
roof 
"Oh leave her be, she'll just be a pain" Aeka said
 "Aeka" tenchi whispered in a mad voice, though no-one herd.

Tenchi and Ryoko met that night on the bolder "Tenchi?" "yeah?" "Im 
going to miss you" "ill miss you too" he kissed her soft lips and 
started to unbutton her dress "Tenchi?" "yeah?" "promise me we'll tell 
them soon" he looked up at her "I promise, we will when I get back"

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

the next day he left, not know what was to be.
