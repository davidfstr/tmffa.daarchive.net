 500 years ago Jurai was a powerful planet but was saddened by the loss 
of both their two princesses Ayeka and Sasami, and their prince Yosho. The 
eldest princess and prince Yosho, were meant to be wed, but after yosho's 
disappearance princess Ayeka and her sister left in search for him. Since then 
Jurai has not heard from either parties yet, and has begun to lose hope. It was 
then that it seemed the opportune time to stage an attack on the Juraian 
throne.

The horrible warlord known as King Diablo saw this chance and took it, 
he saw himself as the king of the universe and would not allow the empire of 
Jurai to appose that title. He and the awesome power he had at his disposal 
attacked Jurai head on without mercy. It was a great battle and even though 
Diablo's forces were outnumbered they were fierce and held their ground 
without fail. It would be known in Jurai's history as the Devil's War. 
Although Diablo's forces were eventually defeated, King Diablo himself was 
unharmed, and he swore he would return to destroy all of jurai.

Jurai would always fear the return of King Diablo, Because of all the 
enemies Jurai has faced he was the most evil and powerful. Since then the 
planet had recovered from the war, and has even regained contact with their 
lost heirs, Princesses Ayeka, Sasami, and Prince Yosho. It had been a 
terrible ordeal for the planet and the war was decreed public secret, and was 
not spoken of unless absolutely necessary.

Back on earth, Washu was examining her new guest. He was an 
incredible specimen, she thought, he seemed to be recovering from his 
massive wounds all by himself. She observed the recording of his decent onto 
this planet over and over again, it was unbelievable, how could he have 
survived the fall? She watched in amazement as the man in black began to 
awake. He sat up on the table he was on and rubbed his head. He looked 
around and found Washu behind a control panel. He didn't react; he just 
stared at her waiting for her to make the first move.      
" Well hello stranger!" she said nervously " you took a pretty bad fall. 
We brought you here for medical attention, but I guess you didn't need it." 
She chuckled at her own joke.
The man was still, until he closed his eyes and breathed deeply. Washu 
didn't know what he was doing until she noticed his clothes began to move! 
What was once tattered and burnt started to morph and change into regular 
good conditioned clothes. Parts of his body that were bare, had the black 
shirt ink over them returning his outfit into what seemed as good as new. The 
man returned his gaze towards Washu.
"Wow! That was unbelievable! I must get a piece of your costume, so I 
can examine it!" Washu was quite excited by the thought. 
"Who are you?" the man in black asked.
"Who me? Why I'm Washu! The greatest scientific genius in the 
universe!" she held out her hand and made the V sign. " Now who might you 
be, my enigmatic friend?"
"My name is Dante."
 "Ooh! Nice name. Very dramatic."
Washu was trying desperately to break the tension, if not only to get him 
to stop staring at her. He had such an intimidating look to him, and his eyes 
seemed so haunted. Washu could tell this guy had his issues, and she was 
beginning to regret bringing him here.
"  Thank you for your kindness." Dante said.
Washu was thrown back by the sudden change in his demeanor. She was 
not expecting much gratitude considering she didn't do anything. 
"Who was the woman that helped me out of the crater?" Dante asked.
"That was Ryoko! She's my daughter! You know, she was pretty 
concerned about you. We all were actually, it's not very common for 
someone to fall like you did and live."    
 "I can take a lot of damage." Dante responded.
"Oh I'm sure you can, but you mind telling me just what happened to you 
exactly?" Washu was very curious as to how he had gotten in that situation.
Dante remained silent; he did not answer her.
"Okay then Mr. Mystery Man, don't tell me. But don't expect to make a 
bunch of friends by not telling them anything about yourself." Washu scolded. 
"I don't expect to make a bunch of friends. I should leave now." He 
said seriously.
"Whoa! C'mon now what's the rush, you don't have to tell me anything if 
you don't want to I understand." Washu felt bad if she had offended him in 
some way.

Out of the blue Mihoshi came stumbling into the lab. How she kept 
getting in here Washu would never know. Mihoshi found the two of them and 
stepped up.
" Hi Washu! Sasami sent me to come get you both because supper is 
ready." Mihoshi said then smiled at Dante. " I'm glad you're awake!  Sasami 
was so worried about you, but she was convinced you'd be awake by the 
time she made dinner. She even made a special plate just for you!"
" Hear that! A special plate just for you! How could you leave without 
eating something someone made just for you?" Washu was irritating him now.
" Alright I'll eat." 
" Great! Sasami will be so happy!" Mihoshi said "I'll go tell her right 
away!"

Dante was not all that thrilled about being around people again, the last 
time he was it ended badly. This Washu seemed interesting enough, and it 
was nice being by people who weren't trying to kill you. So he breathed in, 
stood up and walked with Washu out of her lab and into the dinning room. 

When he got there it was an awkward scenario, the other people that 
Washu spoke of were very surprised to see him up and about. They also just 
didn't know what to say.
" Uh.well, hello. My name is Tenchi Masaki." Tenchi was the first and 
only one to speak up. 
" My name is Dante." 
Everyone introduced themselves to Dante and settled into their seats. It 
was still an uncomfortable atmosphere, for no one really knew a thing about 
this guy. Some of them were getting a bit paranoid even. Dante wasn't at 
ease either; it was not his ideal environment to be by so many people. He 
ignored his discomfort though and focused on eating the generous meal 
prepared for him. The young one Sasami was a very good cook, he admitted 
to himself. The meal went by quickly, no one said much, and he was the first 
to finish. When he did finish however, he put down his plate and just sat 
there, he didn't know what to do.
"Was the food good?" Sasami asked him. She was the only one who 
wasn't afraid of him. Everyone else seemed to be scared to say anything but 
she saw something in this person. Something good. Something that was deep 
down inside him, and something that needed someone just like her to help 
bring it out.
" Yes, the meal was very good." Dante said. 
"Excuse me Mr. Dante but how long do you plan on staying here with 
us? I mean it seems it's like every other month that we get a new alien, or 
something living here and it's just getting crowded." Noboyuki asked.
"Dad!" Tenchi shouted!   
"What? It is getting crowded! And I just don't know how many more 
aliens we have room for."
"No one said anything about him staying here!" Tenchi argued.
"No one ever does, but they end up staying here anyway." Noboyuki 
argued back.
" Hey guys calm down, I don't think he has any plans on staying. Isn't 
that right Dante?" Washu chimed in.
" Yes. I should be on my way."  Dante answered. 
" NO!  Dante don't go!" Sasami started " you're still recovering from 
your fall! And.and.I just don't want you to go."
" Sasami, I don't want to be a burden." Dante tried to calm her down.
"Yes, Sasami, he has places to go on his own, and." Ayeka was also 
trying to soothe her sister but Sasami wouldn't have it.
" Do You? Do you have somewhere to go?" Sasami was determined.
" No, but."
"See! How can we send him away if he doesn't have anywhere to go?" 
Sasami was on the verge of tears when Tenchi finally surrendered.
"Okay Sasami he can stay if he wants to." Tenchi said in that kindly tone 
that only Tenchi Masaki could do. He then turned to Dante.  "You're 
welcome to stay, we really do have room. And besides it'd be nice to have 
another guy around the house."
"Listen Tenchi, I ." he was about to refuse when he saw Sasami's giant 
eyes looking at him all glary and cute. And he just couldn't say no. " Fine 
then, I will stay until my wounds are fully recovered." 
" Oh thank you so much!" Sasami was pleased.
"Oh great! Well there goes my room. I guess I'll just go get an apartment 
or something, near the office." Noboyuki said grimly. 
" Thanks Dad." Tenchi said.
"Wait, so this guy we hardly know, who has already shown us that he 
can survive falling from outer space, let alone anything we can do, and is 
wearing all black, is going to stay with us just because Sasami wants him 
too?" Ryoko recapped in disbelief.

"I guess so." Ayeka said while hugging her sister.     
       
 "Well.this is definitely going to be interesting." Dante thought.
