DISCLAIMER: I own nothing, got nothing and never will have anything, so don't sue.

Now for Ishtaar's little rant:
It has come to my knowledge at the lack of non-lemon yuri fics out there, and I am appalled, 
especially considering there are about 5-9 main female characters in each series, and only about 
3 guys. What are the others gonna do?!? Think about it for a second, the others aren't just gonna 
sit around and be alone, NO!!! It's highly improbable that there isn't one lesbian in that entire 
household. Now for all of you that agree with me or have actually written a yuri, GOOD FOR 
YOU, but for the rest of you, START HOLDING UP YOUR END OF THE BARGAIN!!!

Aaron: All right, Ishtaar, I think they get the point. Now get on with our fic.

Okay, fine. But I get a cookie.

Aaron: Sure, whatever you want, now get on with it!

K, here we go!

`Ishtaar, Prince of Malevolent Tendencies' presents:
Forevermore
*************************************************************************************************

Pure, beautiful silence fell over the Masaki household. Nothing moved, nothing stirred, all was 
quiet.

Detective Kiyone Makabi was not quite so lucky. Her eyes were red and puffy; they burned like 
the furnace of hell. Her head pounded in tremendous pain. But she was long past caring; this had 
been going on for days..insomnia. She couldn't say anything of course, if she had learned 
anything from her parents it's that she had to be strong and get through this by herself. Her head 
rolled to her side, she gazed upon her blonde-haired partner through weary eyes. Her vision was 
blurred, but she could still see her partner's innocent beauty in the dark; it shone like a diamond.  
She thought to herself, <She's so peaceful lying there, I wish I could be like that, so carefree, so 
innocent.. so cute?> She shook her head violently despite the immense pain it caused 
<CUTE!?! What am I thinking?> But she couldn't seem to break the thought from her mind. 
<Maybe this Insomnia is finally getting to me.>

"Oh..*snore*..I'm sorry Kiyone." 

Kiyone giggled at Mihoshi's sleeping form, <So cute, talking in her sleep.> This time she ignored 
the word.

"I didn't.*sniff*.didn't want to make you hate me. She rolled over, exposing to Kiyone her tear-
streaked face. I'm sorry..*sniff*.."

Kiyone's stomach tightened in remorse. <Hate her, what made her think that?> Kiyone felt tears 
of her own roll down her face. She wiped them away quickly and turned away from the sobbing 
blonde. <No must be strong..stay strong>

The next Morning
***

Mihoshi contently munched away at her breakfast. Kiyone looked a little better than the night 
before, but now she was plagued with what Mihoshi had said.

 <She thinks I hate her! Oh, feel like shit right now..lower than shit> She looked up to Mihoshi 
kindly and got the same happy smile she always got. They both looked away. <How can she hold 
it in like that?>

A familiar crash and some yelling came upstairs, the obvious answer; Ayeka and Ryoko. 

Ayeka chased Ryoko down, the stairs, not that Ryoko needed to use them; she just liked toying 
with her would-be a rival. Once she and Tenchi had gotten back from Jurai there hadn't been 
much competition anymore. Ayeka's voice screeched out as Ryoko coolly dodged her attack, 
"How dare you try to defile Lord Tenchi like that! When will you learn that he and I were meant for 
each other?"

"Defile him? Now why would I do that? I just wanted to make him happy." Ryoko cackled evilly, 
more like Washuu than she would ever care to admit. 

Tenchi came into view, quickly pulling up is pants. She sighed at her, "Ryoko, I appreciate the 
concern, really, but you've got to quit waking me up like that!" Ryoko snickered and flew over to 
Tenchi hanging on his arm.

"I'm sorry, Tenchi. But didn't you like it?" Tenchi blushed profusely. 

"Take your arm of him right now you harlot!" Ayeka screamed.

Tenchi turned to her, shaking his head, "And Ayeka, why can't you just accept us? I love you too," 
He quickly crouched away from Ryoko's evil gaze before squeaking out, "just not in the same 
way." Ryoko smiled and hung around his shoulders once again.

"I love you too, Tenchi." Ryoko said.

Ayeka let out a defeated sigh and made her way over to the kitchen. Inside, Sasami was busy 
talking to Grandpa about the things they missed about Jurai, Mihoshi was happily humming to 
herself and Kiyone was sitting quietly, playing with her food. Ayeka plopped down heavily and 
began to eat. Tenchi and Ryoko followed in, kissing quickly before sitting down and eating 
themselves. Washuu was nowhere to be seen all day. usually a bad sign. 

"Hey Kiyone," Mihoshi's cheery voice piped up.

Kiyone's head snapped out of it's trance and in her direction, "Yes, Mihoshi?"

"After patrol do you wanna go to the Karaoke bar? We got lots of extra money from working at 
that coffee shop and we don't have to pay that much for rent anymore."

Kiyone sighed heavily. "I don't know, Mihoshi. I mean we just got fired again and-" She noticed 
the sad look on Mihoshi's face. She forced a grin, "Alright, we'll go!"

Mihoshi perked up immediately, "Yay! Thanks Kiyone!" She got up and gave Kiyone a strong hug 
before running upstairs leaving her blushing. 

Tenchi turned to her, "You know, Kiyone. You don't have to pay any rent, it's really a pleasure 
having you here."

Kiyone shook her head, "I know, but it wouldn't feel right staying here for free."

Ryoko let out and exasperated sigh, "Geez Kiyone, you need to learn to enjoy things more often. 
Tenchi's right, you should-"

"Let her be Ryoko, if she wants to, she wants to." Tenchi interrupted. 

The conversation stopped then and there as it turned to more comfortable matters.

Later that day
***

The two GP detectives sat in silence aboard the Yagami. The only noise filling the air was the 
sanguine humming of Mihoshi, some tune unknown to Kiyone; who, in this quiet, period took the 
time to closely study Mihoshi. 

She noticed how with every beat, she would twirl her feel and bob her head to one side, causing 
her blonde bangs to bounce back and forth. She noticed how her eyes seemed to reflect the pure 
childhood innocence with their sky-blue brilliance. She noticed her-

"Kiyone?"

She noticed her return her steady gaze.

She blushed and looked at her feet. "I'm sorry, was I bothering you. I'll stop." 

Kiyone broke into a saddened smile at her reaction. "No Mihoshi, you can keep humming. It 
was....kind of nice. I was just wondering what song it was."

Mihoshi smiled and nodded, then she cocked her head to one side. "Don't you remember Kiyone, 
it's called `Forevermore'. We sang it at the bar and we got a standing ovation."

Kiyone blushed at remembering this she was really embarrassed, standing up there with 
Mihoshi..holding her, arm in arm. Kiyone let out a nostalgic sigh. Mihoshi caught it. She looked 
slyly out of the side of her eye. "You wanna sing it again tonight?" 

Kiyone's blush deepened and she nodded nervously, "Uh....sure Mihoshi."

Mihoshi smiled and lay back in her seat. <Thought so.> Then she frowned again. <But she was 
so nervous about it. I bet she really hates singing with me, she's so sweet to fake liking it.> She 
gazed longingly at Kiyone for a long time, then went back to humming. 

Kiyone's smile settled again. 

***
Karaoke Bar
***

Kiyone took a small sip from her sake. They had been there for hours but every time Mihoshi 
wanted to sing with her she had found some way to get out of it. She had sung a few herself, but 
her scores were never that good, neither were Mihoshi's. But the thought of them singing together 
had suddenly made her feel....well, weird. Mihoshi sighed heavily and set down her Shirley 
Temple. "Hmmm....Kiyone, you said we could sing together tonight. We always do well, so why 
don't you want to?" She looked down sadly and said so quietly it was almost a whisper, "Do you 
not like singing with me?" 

Kiyone looked shocked. She shook her head and held her hand gently. "No, of course not! I love 
singing with you." <Love?!? How could I say love?!?> Kiyone looked quite embarrassed but 
continued talking. "It's just....I don't know, I guess I'm just nervous."

Mihoshi nodded sadly and forced a smile, "It's okay, Kiyone. You don't have to if-"

Kiyone shook her head and cut in with, " No, I want to." She clasped Mihoshi's other hand. Now it 
was Mihoshi's turn to blush. "Lets go!"

Mihoshi dragged the still nervous Kiyone up to the stage. She fiddled with the Karaoke Machine 
for a minute, then the music started: Low and smooth at first, it started to build up.

Mihoshi started, her voice strong and radiant:

"Feel the wind
Feel the sun
and our new in paradise day has only begun"

Kiyone came in then, voice wavering a bit from nervousness, but soon it started to pick up:

"On the sand by the sea
It's a peaceful oasis made for you and for me
Take my hand....."

Mihoshi's voice came back; still keeping it's strength from before:

"This place was always waiting
This beauty all around us"

Kiyone started again, this time with new confidence:

"The air intoxicating
Just like the love that found us"

Mihoshi and Kiyone's voices came together, the result was brilliant, the audience was silent upon 
hearing it:

"Let's forget who we've been
And give in to the dream
Maybe life is a song
That's how it seems......

And forevermore we'll hear the music play
Yes forevermore I'll take you in my arms this way
And forevermore we'll know the melody
We will sing forevermore, just like the peaceful sea"

Mihoshi's voice was nothing compared to the sound before it, but it still held a certain radiance to 
it:

"Past the clouds
Past the sky
We can only imagine what great mysteries lie"

Kiyone started, now nervous again upon finding Mihoshi's fingers interlocked in her own:

"Other moons
Other stars
Close your eyes and together we'll go wandering far
Take my hand....."

Mihoshi squeezed her partner's fingers:

"This miracle's undying
It never will forsake us"

Kiyone squeezed back and pulled her close:

"We'll always keep on flying
Wherever love may take us"

Mihoshi and Kiyone were now inches apart, the sound of them together was incredible:

"Let's forget who we've been
And give in to the dream
Maybe life is a song
That's how it seems......

And forevermore we'll hear the music play
Yes forevermore I'll take you in my arms this way
And forevermore we'll know the melody
We will sing forevermore, just like the peaceful sea"

Everyone in the audience instantly stood up and started clapping and whistling wildly. Kiyone 
blushed deeply. She felt Mihoshi's warm hand on her side and she panicked, she quickly pulled 
away and held her hands behind her back. She hid her face from Mihoshi in shame. Mihoshi 
sighed sadly and looked away from Kiyone. 

<I was right then.....she does hate me.>  Mihoshi slowly made her way back to the bar, ignoring 
the cheering audience. 

Kiyone sat down next to her, still looking away. <Oh, Kami-sama, that was so mean.....why did I 
do that? Why were we holding hands like that?!? I'm so confused.....> She nervously looked up at 
Mihoshi who was looking away, Kiyone almost saw the shiny teardrops streak down her face. 

***
That night
***

They hadn't said another word to each other the rest of the night. They had slipped in around 
11:00 without waking up anyone, quietly made there way up to the guest room, and changed into 
their pajama's. Just as Kiyone was tucking herself in she heard and small whimper for behind her.

Mihoshi stood there, shuffling her feet and tightly holding her teddy bear (She has one in my story 
cause I like teddy bears, so Bleh!). Small tear streaks trailed down her face. "Ki-*sniff*-Kiyone.....If 
you're not too mad, *sniff* c-can I sleep with you tonight, I had a bad *sniff* dream last night."

Kiyone's heart melted at the sight, a comforting smile spread across her face. She lifted up the 
covers, invitingly. "Of course, Mihoshi. Hop in."

Mihoshi wiped her tears away and smiled warmly. "Thanks a lot, Ki-*sniff*-one." She slid under 
the covers and cuddled close to Kiyone. Kiyone gasped at first but calmed at the comfortable 
warmth radiating from her body.

***
1:00 A.M.
***

Kiyone was still awake, of course. But now her head didn't seem to hurt as much as she listened 
to her blonde partner mumble innocently in her sleep. The sound was rather.....well, calming. She 
knew she wouldn't get to sleep anytime soon, so listening to her was the best alternative. 

"Ki.....ne I.....*sniff*.....lo.....you....." Mihoshi mumbled softly. This caught Kiyone's attention 
immediately. 

She whispered into her ear. "What did you say, Mihoshi?"

"Sorry.....Kiyone. Please don't.....*sniff*.....hate me. I....." Tears flowed in a steady stream down 
her face. 

"I don't hate you, please believe me." Mihoshi didn't seem to hear it though. <Kami-sama, why 
can't I tell her when she's awake. What am I afraid of.>

"I.....love you, Kiyone." Mihoshi  turned over again, she became silent, except for the soft weeping 
of her dreaming. 

Kiyone lay there, stunned. Her blood ran cold and her face grew hot with embarrassment. "Sh-
she loves.....me?" She thought carefully, her head now throbbing with the all too familiar pain that 
she thought she had escaped that night. She was evidently, wrong. <I've got to talk to her!>

End chapter 1.

Aaron: *Ahem*
Oh, right. So how'd you like it. I know Kiyone seemed a little OOC, but then again, she does have 
insomnia so it shouldn't seem that bad.
