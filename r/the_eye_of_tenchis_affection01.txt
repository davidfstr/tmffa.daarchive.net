    "Wake up sleepy-head," Sasami nudged Tenchi on the shoulder, "it's time
to eat."
    "Yeah, yeah, just gimme a sec all right." Gradually Tenchi got up, opened
his eyes, and checked out his clock. -8:45am- "Ahh, I'm gonna be late for school, I'd
better hurry up!" he quickly jumped to his feet and rushed down the stairs. "Man how 
late did I stay up, GEEZ now I'm gonna be late." He burst his way through his front 
door and began to sprint to school. "only ten minutes and I'm late!"

                                *Ten Minutes later*
        "Welcome to class Mr.Masaki, finally decide to join the us?" his sensai
Mr.Hukimoro questioned. Tenchi was speechless, so he just smiled, and sat
down. 'I better not stay up so late anymore' Tenchi thought to himself 'or
I'm really gonna get myself into trouble, but I did have fun, so I guess it
was worth it.'
     "Hay Tenchi, boy you look tired, what were ya' doing last night, huh?" implied Amogaski, 
Tenchi's friend. 
     "Ahh, shut up Amogaski!" Tenchi delivered a right first into Amogaski's mouth. "Got it!"
The day slowly went by very uneventfully. At 3:30 the bell rang and Tenchi went flying out 
the door.  "Finally, time for some peace and quite" As Tenchi approached the shrine he
 smiled, "I'm glad Ayeka's gone, now Ryoko and her aren't fighting, and I can 
finally relax, especially with dad gone." 
     "Tenchi your getting slow," Grandfather Katsuhito implied, ",you expect  to ever be able
 to beat me and you can only run that fast, for that you have to clean my room, unless you can 
challenge me in battle."
     "AHH, Grandpa I don't have time, not now!" Tenchi stated as he ran past his Grandfather,
 "maybe  later, but not today"
     "In a hurry Tenchi, or afraid of a challenge?" boasted Katsuhito as he ran towards Tenchi
 yielding a five foot bokken, " You will fight me now!" He slapped the bamboo bokken over 
Tenchi's legs. Tenchi let out a yell of pain, toppled to the ground, and quickly dodged his
 grandfather's next swing by rolling on the ground. 
     "Really Grandpa, I don't wanna fight you now." 
      "But you will!" Grandfather rebutted. " Now draw a weapon." Tenchi grabbed a
 broom from off the ground, and began to swing furiously at Katsuhito's face, 
"Finally Tenchi, you fight me like a man!" mumbled Katsuhito as he delivered a blow to
 Tenchi's stomach.
     "AHHHH, Grandpa that really hurt," he growled in pain "now I'll return the favor."
 Tenchi finally landed a hit on Grandpa's head, it barely stunned the martial arts expert.
Grandpa swiftly dodged Tenchi's next attacks , and gave Tenchi a fierce baseball swing
 to the side of his head, and launched him into a nearby tree.
     "That's all for today Tenchi." Tenchi could barely hear his Grandfather as he fell
 into blackness. An hour latter he awoke entangled in the tree's branches. He came to his 
feet standing on a nearly broken branch of the tree, which quickly snapped sending Tenchi
 to the ground. He then stumbled his way to the foot of the stairs to the Masaki shrine.
 He swaggered from side to side with dizziness as he attempted to walk down the stairs
 towards his house. By the time he was at the third stair he bagan to blackout once again.
 Unable to stand he dropped to his knees and tumbled down the stairs.
        
                *mean while Sasami and Ryoko prepared dinner in the kitchen* 
     'Boy, I hate workin', if Tenchi hadn't asked me to help I wouldn't even be thinking
 about doing this' Ryoko thought as she set the table.
     "Ryoko could you go get Tenchi and Grandpa ," Sasami called out cheerfully from
 the Kitchen , "dinners almost ready."
     Ryoko wander about the house cluelessly, until she stumbled upon Katsuhito walking
 around the house, "Hey grandpa, I mean Lord Katsuhito it's time to eat, and where's Tenchi?"
     "Last time I saw him he was still practicing," Katsuhito stated in his usual calm 
manner. "He should still be somewhere around the shrine. Well, I'm gonna go eat now."
     "Ok, I'll go find him," Ryoko stated as she walked away. As she floated over the
 path she noticed, out of the corner of her eye, Tenchi laying  on the ground, 
very bruised. "OHH, Tenchi!"

     Tenchi awoke at the foot of his bed. Ryoko was standing over him, holding ice on his head,
 watching him sleep as she frequently did. "Are you all right my love?"
     "Yes, but..." Tenchi stopped in mid sentence as Ryoko placed her finger over his mouth.
     "Don't talk now, just rest Tenchi my dear." Ryoko stated as she removed her finger 
from Tenchi's lips. "I'm going to go get you some food, just stay here."
      Tenchi raised his head and checked his clock -10:53 pm-. He began to think to himself ,
 'Why is Ryoko so worried about me, she's stayed awake this long just to help me??? Maybe she
 really does love me???' Ryoko phased through the wall with a tray in her hand. 
Tenchi smiled, he was glad she was back. He began to blush "You must eat to 
regain your strength" Ryoko said as she gave him a seductive smile.
      "Ryoko, I had a lot of fun with you last night at the carnival. Maybe we 
can go again some time?"
      "Sure, but now you must eat." She had a bigger smile than 
Tenchi had ever seen her have before. He also had a smile bigger than Ryoko had ever
seen before.
	"Thanks alot Ryoko," Tenchi said as he crammed a an abundance of rice
down his throat, "if it weren't for you I'd be laying in a pile of leaves now, 
thanks." 
	"Just eat now." Ryoko asked as she but her hand on his leg. With another
suductive smile she stated, "You can thank me later."
	'Later???' Tenchi thought to himself, 'How should I thank her??? What's
she want??? I'v got an idea!' 
	"You wanna goto the carnival tomorrow, just me and you?" Tenchi asked. 
Ryoko blushed. She was speechless, but Tenchi knew that was a yes.
	'Damn that Zero (*see OVA episode #11-12 for the story of Zero*) , but if 
it weren't for her Tenchi wouldn't know how I feel, so I guess I can 
handle this slight embarressment.' Ryoko thought to herself. 
	Tenchi began to smile and think to himself, 'What am I doing, if Ayeka 
finds out about this she'll have a fit. Wait why am I worrying about Ayeka?
She doesn't own me.' After several hours of conversation Tenchi fell asleep,Ryoko 
phased into Tenchi's desk chair and stayed awake watching him sleep.
		*The next morning*
	Tenchi awoke the next morning and checked his clock -10:23am-. Out of
the corner of his eye he noticed Ryoko asleep in the bed laying next to him.
'I guess I'll just take today off school since I'm still so tired and sore, and
since Grandpa doesn't mind by letting me sleep so long, I guess it's ok with him.'
He layed his head back down near Ryoko's shoulder and fell back asleep.
