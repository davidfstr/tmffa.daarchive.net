CUE OPENING CREDITS SONG:"Tenchi Muyo! TV Theme" Basacally the same as the TV opening with the
following changes: Megumi is chasing Kamadake.
			 A Tenchi and Seion sparing sesion	
			 Nagi's in it
			 Misaki, Tsunami, and Sasami are in the kitchen
			 Aeka and Ryoko are not fighting over Tenchi.

SCENE 1: The Living Room. Kiyone and Noboyuki are packed for a ski trip to Nagano. The rest
	of the "family" is gathered around recieving the instructions.

KIYONE: Ryoko, here are the keys to the shop. Do NOT lose them. I don't want you trying to 
	pick the lock to get in. You girls know what to do about deliveries. Tenchi, here's 
	an extra set of shop keys, the recipt to the new delivery van that they'll be bringing
        by, and a little book so you can write down everytime Seion misbehaves.

SEION: Hey! When do I ever misbehave?

KIYONE: Which of the 48 books shall I read from?

AEKA: How did you ever get to be a Galaxy Police Special Operative with such behaviour?

SEION: Let's just say I'm the best at what I do.

RYOKO: You mean sneaking up on a group of thugs and beating the crap outta them?

SEION: Bingo!	
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SFX: Eeeeeeeeeeoooo!
EPISODE 37: NO NEED FOR RASCALS!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SCENE 2: The Road to Nagano

	Just Noboyuki and Kiyone in the van.

KIYONE: This is gonna be a wonderful vacation.

NOBOYUKI: Well, we deserve it. After all, we have a house full of young men and women, not
	two little kids.

KIYONE: I take it your referring to Sasami and Seion.

NOBOYUKI: Exactly.

KIYONE: I wonder if Tenchi can handle him........
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SCENE 3: The Masaki House

	Tenchi is writing in that little book
 
TENCHI: 2:58pm-Seion gives Azaka a wedgie. When Kamadake objects, he gets one too.
	  3:00pm-Seion noogies me.
	  3:15pm-Seion cheats during a game of poker.
	  4:03pm-Seion and Mihoshi are making out in the bath.
	(Seion walks in)

SEION: Hey, whatcha writing? Let me see.

TENCHI: 5:21pm-Seion demands that I turn over the book to him.

SEION: Why you little- gimme that! (he makes a grab for the book)

TENCHI: (ducking outta the way) 5:21:29pm-Seion threatens me with bodily harm.

SEION: Right! I'll do you for that!
	
TENCHI: (running down the hall) 5:21:43pm-Seion threatens my life!

SEION: Why I oughta kill you!

TENCHI: 5:21:57-Seion comtemplates regicide.

SEION: 5:22pm-Seion takes my little book! Yoink!(Seion takes Tenchi's book and looks
	through it.) Hey, there's nothing in here but little hentai drawings of Ryoko
	and Aeka and giant robots with BAFG's and buster swords!

TENCHI: Uhhhhhh, heh heh!

SEION: Where'd you learn to draw like this? This is good.

TENCHI: Well, I'm trying to get into manga writing. 

SEION: You ever try to talk Ryoko and Aeka into doing the stuff you drew here?

TENCHI: Hey! (and out of thin air, the Crown Prince of Jurai's two "fiances" 
	appear)
	
RYOKO: Let me see that! (she takes the book for Aeka and herself to look through)
	Wow! I never thought you had a mind like this, Tenchi!

AEKA: (blushing) You know, you didn't have to have us doing THAT to each other!

SEION: You mean you don't ever fantasize about that stuff?

RYOKO: Sure. I fantasize about alot of stuff. How about you, Aeka. (She smiles
	that impish smile of hers)

AEKA: Of course I do, but.......I....you see.....I only.....you know....with
	Ryoko and.....but you need to......ARRRRRGGGGGGGGG! 

TENCHI: (trying to stop a nose bleed) You could have let me know you felt like
	that about each other. Would've saved me alot of headaches!

SEION: And prevented alot of blood loss!

TENCHI: Ryoko.

RYOKO: Aeka.

AEKA: Let's get him! (enter the chase scene, with Seion being the chasee)

MEANWHILE, IN THE LIVING ROOM..........

	Washu, Sasami, Megumi, Demi, Mihoshi, Misaki, Nagi, Azaka, Kamadake, and Yosho are
        gathered in the front room with Washu's Age Changing Screen.

MIHOSHI: Wow! So this is what you use to change ages?

WASHU: Yep! When you step behind this screen, you can be any age you want. You'll still 
	have all the skills you already possess, but you'll be just like anyone else 
	that age!

SASAMI: Oh boy! I'd like to see what you guys were like when you where my age!

MISAKI: Oh, to be 19 again! What do you think, Yosho?

YOSHO: I don't think so. You should stay the age you already are. (then he starts thinking
 	about what Misaki said) Hmmmmmm. It would be nice to just have a look though.

	(And right on cue, a mass containing two Jurian Royals, a space pirate, and a Galaxy
	Police Special Operative comes rolling down the stairs, over the couch, and into the
	changing screen, causing it to explode. When Washu pops up as the Adult version, she
	looks around at the carnage, she finds 8 year old version of Tenchi, Ryoko, Aeka, and 
	Megumi, 10 year old versions of Seion, Nagi, Azaka, Kamadake, Mihoshi, and Demi, and 
	18-19 year old versions of Sasami, Misaki, and Yosho)

WASHU: Uh-oh. (Washu-A and Washu-B appear on her shoulders)

WASHU-A: You're in a jam now, Washu!

WASHU-B: You blew it, Washu!
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
SFX: Eeeeyoooo! (wood blocks)
(picture of Ryo-oki and Ken-oki in ship form bumping into each other)
=====================================================
COMMERCIAL BREAK

SCENE: P-chan sitting on a building looking over into a window with Ukyo cooking 
	okinamiyoki and singing "Only You" to her (or is it the meal she's making)

ANNOUNCER: Fall in love with a Japanese Pizza all over again, now only 150 yen for a 
regular with the purchase of a large drink for a limited time only at Uchan's.

	(P-chan is now in Ukyo's arms. He looks into the camera and says, in Japanese)

P-CHAN: I want Uchan's!
=====================================================
SFX:Eeeeyoooo!(wood blocks)
(picture of the cabbits with a bunch of carrots slung over Ken-oki's back)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
SCENE 4: Outside of the Masaki Residence

	Kiyone and Noboyuki walk up to the door.

KIYONE: That was fun. We were there for four days and only went skining once.

NOBOYUKI: But the rest of the time.......

KIYONE: Now behave yourself. We'll have time for that a little later. Just as long as
	something bad hasn't happened to the kids, we'll be in our room and- (as she opens
	the door, she nearly steps on the Demi-chan, who is asleep and curled up like a 
	kitten (she is a cat person after all)-What the hell? What did Washu do to Demi?

NOBOYUKI: Demi nothing! Look on the couch! (and on the couch is Mihoshi, Megumi, and 
	Kamadake watching TV) If they're like this too, then......MY SON! (Noboyuki runs
	upstairs)

KIYONE: Oh no. If Seion's like this too, then may the goddesses have mercy on our souls.

MIHOSHI: METAMORFORCE! Go MOLDIVER!

KIYONE: Well, at least Mihoshi hasn't changed much.

MEANWHILE, UPSTAIRS..........

		Noboyuki runs into Tenchi's room and see's his now 8 year old son and his 
	fiances of about the same age having a tea party. They look to the adult.

NOBOYUKI: Tenchi! What happened to you?

TENCHI: Dad!

RYOKO: Hey, you can't come in here!

AEKA: This is a private tea party! No boys allowed!

NOBOYUKI: But you let Tenchi in.

RYOKO: She said no BOYS! We're allowed to have one.

AEKA: Now get out before I have Azaka and Kamadake take you away! (Aeka leads him out and
	shuts the door)

NOBOYUKI: Well, at least he's not running from them anymore.

		Back downstairs, three blue-haired, red-eyed Jurian ladies walk in. They
        look like they have been chased through the woods by a wild animal.

SASAMI: That wasn't fun.

MISAKI: You got that right.

TSUNAMI: I'm not going after him this time.

KIYONE: Going after who, Misaki?

TSUNAMI: I'm Tsunami.

KIYONE: Sorry. What happened, Sasami?

MISAKI: I'm Misaki! She's Sasami!

KIYONE: Whatever! Just ask Sasami what happened!

MISAKI: Sasami, Kiyone wants to know what happened.

KIYONE: Start from the begining.

SASAMI: Well, first there was the big bang. Then the universe expanded and cooled. Then
	the dust condensed into planets and stars. Then the Jurians came and........

KIYONE: I meant from the time we left on vacation!

TSUNAMI: Well, we had a little problem with one of Washu's inventions. She's working on the 
	problem now, but the chemicals she's using need a couple of day to cure and she can't
	just send them to another dimension to speed up the process. It could explode if she 
	does.

KIYONE: The invention?

TSUNAMI: More like the dimension.

KIYONE: By the way, have you seen my brother anywhere?

MISAKI: Who do you think did this to us? But that dear, sweet, young prince is out there 
	looking for him right now!

KIYONE: Who?

SASAMI: She means Grampa. 
	(Misaki holds up a picture of her and a youger version of Yosho)

MISAKI: Isn't he the most kawaii man you've ever seen in your life?

SCENE 5: Somewhere on the Masaki property. Yosho, Little Nagi, and her boyfriend Hans are
	walking through the woods looking for a certain little trouble maker.

YOSHO: So, Hans, what do you do for a living?

HANS: I'm a professional mountain climber. I was hired by a German tour company to lead 
	mountain climbing tours here in Japan. I have a friend here in Japan I went up Mount
	Everest, Kilamanjaro, and the Matterhorn with. Masumichi Fujisawa. Ever hear of him?

YOSHO: Oh, yeah. I've seen him a couple of news programs around here before. He's a teacher
	a high school.

NAGI: Well, when we get all fixed up, how would you like to go up that really big mountain 
	on Mars?

HANS: Olympus Mons? Sure. Now I've got something I can throw back at Mas when ever him and
	his wife try and throw Mount Muldoon in my face.
	
	(At that moment, they come upon a makeshift campsite with a rabbit roasting on an open
	fire.)

YOSHO: I wonder who this belongs to?

BOY: Who dares enter the fortress of the Torabushi Seion?

	(They look up in a tree and find the 10 year-old Seion standing on a branch)

NAGI: Fortress? It's just a campfire and a sleeping bag! You big stupidface!

SEION: Stoopid face? (he jumps out of the tree) You take that back!

NAGI: No way!

SEION: You'd better stay away from Nagi, Mister Man. She's got kooties!

NAGI: I do not!

YOSHO: Now, now kiddies. Let's try to act a little more civilized.

SEION: You stay outta this, Tenchi's Grampa! I don't need no stoopid sivelizashun! And do
	something with that hair! You look like a stoopid girl!

YOSHO: A girl? Why you little.....(he tries to grab Seion but gets kicked in the shin for
	his troubles) OW! That really hurt!

HANS: I've had just about enough of this!

SEION: Here's one for you too! (as he takes a kick at Hans, he grabs Seion's fot and holds
	him up in the air) Hey! That's cheating!

HANS: You forget that I was in an counter-terrorist team in the German army. Now lets get 
	back to the house.

SCENE 6: The house. Everyone, ecept for Washu and the three blue haired Jurian ladies are
 	gathered around.

NOBOYUKI: You really did it this time! You're in a lot of trouble!

SEION: Fine. I'll go to my room and think about what I've done.

KIYONE: Oh no you don't. You have your toys up there! You go into the bath and get cleaned
	up!

SEION: Alright. (he opens the door and walks in. Washu then comes out of her lab)

WASHU: Well, I'll have it ready in a couple more hours. I just need to reconfigure some 
	stuff for Seion. Where is he?

KIYONE: I sent him to take a bath.

WASHU: YOU WHAT?!
	(As if on cue, the three azure-tressed ladies burst through the bath door screaming)

TSUNAMI: That little monster is in OUR bath!

SEION:(from the other side of the door) Come on, ladies. I've had my shots!

WASHU: The door kinda got broken during the explosion. I'm afraid that the old bath is now
	lost in another dimension somewhere. Now the door only leads to the ladies bath.

KIYONE: Just great. You take care of Seion, Washu. The rest of you try to be back here in 
	three hours.(Kiyone leaves the room)

YOSHO: Three hours, huh? What do we do to pass the time? (Insert Misaki huggle)

MISAKI: Oh, I think I know a way.

YOSHO: Uh, but what about the others?

SASAMI: It's time for a Street Fighter Zero 2 Gold tournament!

MISAKI: I believe Sasami has already found a solution to that problem.

YOSHO: I guess you got me then. 

HANS: You shouldn't worry. I'm sure by next week everything will be back to normal around 
	here.

NOBOYUKI: Uh, Mr Erichson, this is normal around here.
