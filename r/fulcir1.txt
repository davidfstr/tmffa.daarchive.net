					INTERLUDE
Establishing Shot: The Starry Sky, Saggitarius is center screen. It 
pans down until we see a house.

				ADAM (Off Screen)
		Geeze, where the hell am I? I hope 
		there’s some one in this house that 
		can speak English.

A figure (ADAM LEIGH) walks on screen and heads for the house. He 
reaches the door and slams his fist into the side of the doorway three 
times.

				ADAM
		HEY! Is there anyone in there?

You can hear some rustling inside the house; the sound of feet rushing
down a staircase, then a young boy (TENCHI MASAKI) opens the door.

				TENCHI
		Uhh … Hello, is there …

				ADAM
		Yes! Someone I understand! <exausted>
		Can you tell me where I am? I’m 
		awfully lost?

				TENCHI
		Well, I’m not too good with directions,
		where are you headed?

				ADAM
		Umm, I wasn’t really heading anywhere.
		I was just walking home from the drug 
		store on Franklin. I know it sounds 
		funny getting lost in my own town…

TENCHI looks at ADAM like he’s crazy.

				ADAM
		What? I’m not an imbecile, I was 
		walking and suddenly I got the feeling 
		that I was not where I thought I was.
		And then there was all these trees,
		and I ended up in some Japanese 
		person’s back yard. Listen, just tell 
		me if I’m still anywhere near Oakland.

TENCHI starts and stops several times, then finally gets enough 
courage to continue.

				TENCHI
		Are … I mean … do you know that … 
		What I’m trying to say is that there 
		isn’t any Oakland near here … or at 
		all in this Country. At least … I think.

ADAM facefaults a few times, and then looks at TENCHI like he’s crazy.

				ADAM
		What country are YOU living in? There
		must be eight to twelve Oaklands in the
		US.  At least three in the east coast.

				TENCHI
		I’m living in Japan. At least, last I 
		checked, which is also where your 
		standing.

				ADAM
		<jokingly> JAPAN? Ha!

TENCHI looks at him seriously

				ADAM
		Your not kidding are you? Your NUTS!
		I was in New York, maybe if I’m way lost
		I’ve wandered into New Jersey, but NOT 
		Japan.

ADAM turns around and starts walking away.

				ADAM
		Thanks for you help, a lot of good it 
		did me. <to himself> Japan, really…
		what a loon, must have escaped from 
		a mental institute.

TENCHI watches for a second and closes the door. ADAM continues 
walking away.

		Episode 1: No Need For Americans

				ADAM
		Now where do I go?  Not like I have 
		much choice … perhaps if I can find 
		a road …

ADAM walks right into a giant blue MECHA that looks down at him.  
We see the MECHA’s POV has a greenish view of ADAM with smaller 
displays showing information on ADAM’s physiology.  When ADAM 
speaks, the words sound garbled but understandable.

			ADAM (Not in sync with mouth)
		Owww, my head. Who put this … Uhh … 
		Giant Robot … <panicked> verrrrry bad.
		Must run …

ADAM dashes away from the MECHA back towards the house.  The 
MECHA powers up and jets off after ADAM.  We see ADAM stopping at the 
door of the house and pounding on it again.

				ADAM
		Oh boy, big robot. <yells> HEELLLPP!! 

The MECHA races towards ADAM, it suddenly tries to slow down.  We see
MECHA’s POV showing warnings about hitting house.

				ADAM
		<whines> Oohhh, I shouldn’t have gone 
		out.. should have stayed at ho …

The MECHA is almost slowed down, but it runs into ADAM, smashing him
through the paper thin door way into the foyer of the house.  TENCHI 
has just reached the bottom of the stairs when this happens.

				TENCHI
		What now?

TENCHI looks through the door way to see the MECHA standing there.

				TENCHI
		<softly; nervously> ahhh … <very loud>
		RYOUKO ITS FOR YOU!

RYOUKO comes through a door on the Second floor and leans on the 
railing that is over the foyer.  ADAM gets up and just stares at the 
MECHA, frozen with fear.

				RYOUKO
		Who could it be at this hour?

				TENCHI
		<loudly>IT’S THE SPACE PIRATE!

				RYOUKO
		Oh, right, Space Pirate.

				TENCHI
		<yelling>Yes the Space Pirate you 
		mean you forgot?!!!

The MECHA suddenly straightens itself and aim an arm cannon at ADAM.
TENCHI lets out a worried whine; grabs ADAM and runs up the staircase.
The MECHA fires at the space where ADAM was just lying. The MECHA 
fires shots at TENCHI, ADAM, and RYOUKO as they run up the stairs 
and down a hallway.  It flies after them.

				TENCHI
		<panting; to Ryouko> Isn’t there anything 
		you can do?

				ADAM
		You know, I can run if you put me 
		down, other than that …

TENCHI throws ADAM to the ground and they all continue running, shots 
from the MECHA zing past.

				RYOUKO
		Isn’t this fun?

ADAM and TENCHI shoot her mean looks.  They get to a window as the 
MECHA closes in on them, they all look in terror at the MECHA 
approaching.  TENCHI quickly grabs RYOUKO’s hand and jumps through 
the window, ADAM follows them falling not quite gracefully.  They 
look up at the window for a second, then continue running just as 
the MECHA hits the ground where they were standing.  They head away 
from the house and along a path into the forest.

YOUSHO is sipping hot tea in the temple atop a mountain, when the 
noise and rumbling of several shots being fired cause him to wonder.

				YOUSHO
		<casually> I wonder what is going on.

TENCHI, ADAM, and RYOUKO reach the top of a flight of stairs and 
stop for a moment to catch their breaths.  A shot streams past 
TENCHI’s head and they all scream and run away from the stairs 
towards the Temple.

				ADAM
		<very out of breath> Aerobic isn’t this?

A shot flies past and hits the ground in front of the gang.  They 
all stop and gape at the hole in the ground, then turn to see the 
MECHA looking at them.  YOUSHO appears at the entrance of the Temple.

				YOUSHO
		What’s all the racket?

				TENCHI
		<yells> Grandpa!

				YOUSHO
		Well, well, well, who can even think 
		with all this noise going on?

YOUSHO adjusts his glases and the lenses flash in the moonlight.  
YOUSHO is standing across from the MECHA and they look at each other.
YOUSHO draws his Boduken and charges the MECHA.  In the middle, they 
meet and YOUSHO slashes with his Bokken then leaps out of the way.
The MECHA flashes, buldges, and explodes.

				TENCHI
		Yeah! Grandpa!

				ADAM
		<Sarcastic> Very interesting, but can 
		you cut 3 meter thick Titanium with it?

				TENCHI
		Look!

The smoke around the MECHA begins to clear and we see the rather 
shapely rear end of MIHOSHI.  She wiggles around a bit then turns 
her head to look at the gang.

				ADAM
		Is that …

				MIHOSHI
		Hold it right there Space Pirate!  I’m 
		Detective First Class Mihoshi from 
		Galaxy Police, and your under arrest!

				TENCHI
		Space Pirate? <to RYOUKO> I thought 
		you said she was the space pirate.

				RYOUKO
		What? Are you joking, she’s obviously 
		lying, she probably doesn’t have any 
		proof.  <pouting> Don’t you believe me?

				TENCHI
		Well …

				ADAM
		<flat>No.

				MIHOSHI
		Oh I have proof all right, I have it 
		right here.

MIHOSHI rummages through some unseen pocket that seems unending.

				MIHOSHI
		Hmm… this is not it … no not this … 
		where is it, I know I had it … Oh, how 
		did this get here … and, oh I don’t 
		know WHAT this is …

TENCHI and ADAM nervously sweat.

				MIHOSHI
		Ahhh! Here it is!

MIHOSHI jumps to her feet and hold out a rod that extends to create 
a screen.

				MIHOSHI
		See? Here’s my Galaxy Police ID.  And 
		here is the Warrant for your arrest.

The picture changes to Mihoshi’s picture with her information, then 
switches to a warrant for the arrest of RYOUKO, the picture looks 
just like her.

				RYOUKO
		<sinister chuckling> Well, you finally 
		figured it out.  I was drunk when we 
		first met, but now I’ll show you who 
		the real boss is.

TENCHI and ADAM scramble over to MIHOSHI

				ADAM
		Don’t you have anything to protect us?

MIHOSHI draws her gun and points it at RYOUKO

				MIHOSHI
		Just hold it right there. If you move, 
		I’m going to have to shoot you … 
		and it’ll really hurt.

				RYOUKO
		Go ahead.

MIHOSHI hesitates.

				ADAM
		What are you waiting for? Shoot her!

MIHOSHI fires repetitively, the shots hit an invisible barrier that is 
surrounding RYOUKO.

				RYOUKO
		<chuckling> That’s right, your hunting 
		big game now, too big for the likes of 
		you.

TENCHI, ADAM, and MIHOSHI nervously look watch RYOUKO. MIHOSHI is 
still firing.

				RYOUKO
		Now it's time for retaliation, and plenty 
		of it, too!

RYOUKO flies at TENCHI, ADAM, and MIHOSHI, they all run screaming 
as RYOUKO fires energy beams at them.  The rush down the stairs 
leaving YOUSHO alone by the temple.

				YOUSHO
		Hmmm, a busy night.

TENCHI, ADAM, and MIHOSHI barge back into the house though the broken
door way and run up the stairs, RYOUKO is close behind them.

				ADAM
		<panting>Isn’t this a little familiar.

They come to the window again, they immediately jump out of it, this 
time they don’t land as well.  MIHOSHI lands on her side and ADAM 
lands on her.  ADAM gets up and TENCHI pulls on her arm.

				TENCHI
		Come on!

				MIHOSHI
		No, wait. I can’t move.

				ADAM
		Here she comes!

RYOUKO flies through the window, energy sparkles between her hands, 
she slowly flies towards the three.

				TENCHI
		That’s it!

TENCHI looks around, then picks up a hoe and points it at RYOUKO. 
ADAM looks at the hoe, then at RYOUKO.

				ADAM
		We’re gonna die …

RYOUKO flies down to the ground, the energy disappears from her hands 
and she throws her arms around herself.

				RYOUKO
		Ahh, that was fun wasn’t it?

TENCHI and ADAM facefault, MIHOSHI looks with amazement.

				RYOUKO
		You know I wasn’t really serious, I 
		was just having a little fun you know.

MIHOSHI jumps to her feet.

				MIHOSHI
		You mean you’re going to give up?

				RYOUKO
		I might just do that for you.

				MIHOSHI
		That’ll make things so much more 
		easier.  Let me just find those rights.

MIHOSHI looks through that unseen pocket, finally pulling out a pair 
of rods that she separates to make a screen.

				MIHOSHI
		Okay, You have the right to remain 
		silent about all facts regarding the 
		cause of your arrest, you canno – HEY!

The screen burns in a brief moment of fire. RYOUKO is standing with 
a grin on her face.

				RYOUKO
		Go on.

				MIHOSHI
		I think I know these by heart, Section 
		number 158 … or is it 178?  Section 
		153? Oh, OH! I don’t remember

MIHOSHI breaks down crying.  ADAM raises an eyebrow and RYOUKO sighs.

				RYOUKO
		I could get to like it here.

It’s the next day and inside the Masaki household, ADAM, RYOUKO, 
MIHOSHI, TENCHI, YOUSHO, and TENCHI’s father NOBOYUKI are sitting
around a table drinking Tea and eating cakes and various foods.

				YOUSHO
		Well, you are welcome to stay here 
		with us, such lovely ladies will 
		brighten our day.

				NOBOYUKI
		Yes, If you don’t mind staying here 
		with us Bachelors, huh Tenchi?

				MIHOSHI
		Oh Thank you! Thank you so much!

				RYOUKO
		Oh great, more freeloaders.

				TENCHI
		You’re the one who started all this 
		you know.

Everyone looks to ADAM now.

				TENCHI
		How about you Adam, what are you 
		going to do?

				YOUSHO
		You’re welcome to stay as well.

				ADAM
		Well, I’m not a ‘lovely lady’ but I’m 
		sure I could find a way to brighten 
		your day.

				YOUSHO
		I’m sure you can help Tenchi repair 
		the roof after last night’s firefight.

TENCHI and ADAM look at each other and grimace. Next shot, Tenchi is 
sitting on the roof nailing boards trying to fill the holes.  RYOUKO 
appears next to TENCHI.

				TENCHI
		What do you want?

				RYOUKO
		This isn’t any fun, why don’t you come 
		and have fun with me Tenchi?

				TENCHI
		You know, you are the one who should 
		be doing this. If it weren't for you 
		there wouldn’t be any holes in this roof.

				RYOUKO
		But wasn’t it fun?

				TENCHI
		RYOUK—

RYOUKO puts her finger across TENCHI’s mouth.

				RYOUKO
		No need for arguments.

TENCHI sighs and leans across the roof.

				ADAM (Off Screen)
		No Tenchi! Don’t lean on that board!

The board under TENCHI’s arm gives way and he falls into through the 
roof.  ADAM appears climbing up a ladder holding a couple handfuls 
of support beams.

				ADAM
		<peers down the hole> Well, that’s one 
		way to fly.

ADAM and RYOUKO look at each other and grin.

				RYOUKO
		I think I’m going to like you.

				ADAM
		<flat>Charmed.
