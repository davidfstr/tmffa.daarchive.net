A Second Chance

Chapter #2 : Feelings Realized

As the weeks past Nobuyuki, and Mihoshi became each other's best friend.
She even started to accompany him to his work at the architecture firm.
Mainly to help where she could, and to make sure he didn't bother the girls
there.

He had asked her to help him curb the now learned habit of bothering the
female members of the staff.
And, since she was a police officer (Even a galactic one) she readily
accepted the favor asked of her.
Within a week, Nobuyuki was back to the way he acted when Achika was still
alive.

Nobuyuki also helped Mihoshi as he started to point out some of her habits
that lead to some disastrous
problem either at the house, or within Washu's lab. Within that same span
of time,
Mihoshi became much less accident prone.

Washu had noticed not just the lessening of accidents in her lab, and in
the house,
but the realization that the two were becoming closer by the day.
She smiled a Quirky smile, as she now hatched a plan to make them even
closer.
She theorized, but were lonely , and that since their close friendship was
born, they showed less
negative behaviors (Hen tai, accident prone), and became closer to each
other.

She then approached Tenchi who at first was skeptical of anything Washu was
involved with.
But after she explained to him what had happened between the two, he
readily accepted.
He even got the rest of the girls to help as well. He knew Ayeka, and Ryoko
would
simply because of their rivalry for Tenchi. Sasami was Mihoshi's best
friend, and had also noticed the
changes with her over the last few weeks. She also accepted to be involved.

So they all met right after lunch (And during Mihoshi's midday nap) to plan
out how to get the two closer together.
Within an hour the plan was agreed upon and Operation Miho-Nubi was
officially off the ground and running!
______________________________________________________________________________________________

The Plan Takes Effect

As The conspirators looked anxiously, The two drove up in the Masaki family
van.
Both looked beat and the way they walked into the house showed it.
"Hi, ho everyone, I see the house is still in one piece,
so I assumed a good and peaceful day was had by all?" stated a relieved
Nobuyuki
"So,... you two didn't fight?" asked Mihoshi through tired eyes
Ayeka, and ryoko were about to say some things they would usually say to
the fumbling detective, but a raised hand of Tenchi put a stop to that.
They simply looked at each other warily, and nodded silently.
"Oh goody so the couch is still in one piece so i can watch the Space
police Policeman-a-thon tonight!"
Mihoshi happily said. Nobuyuki smirked a smile at her reaction,
then both headed to their rooms to get ready for the dinner everyone had
smelled and had their mouths watered for.

A the two "targets" came down stairs, the plan started to take effect.
First all the seats were taken but two next to each other. normally
Nobuyuki sat next to Katsuhito,
but that seat was taken by Washu in her adult form, which was unusual for
her.
Mihoshi customarily sat between Sasami and Washu, but Washu's seat was no
vacant
and so with no fanfare, they both sat next to each other.

As dinner progressed and Sasami's cooking skills were exalted again by all,
Washu came up with a suggestion;
"Why don't we all take a walk to settle this fabulous food down!"
All at the table agreed. Since their friendship blossomed, Nobuyuki and
Mihoshi had
nightly took a walk together to Achika's grave, as part of a after dinner
walk.
But, today since the while family was going to walk together, they saw
little chance for them to do that.

But, as the family walked the paths and woods around the Masaki estate,
they slowly separated,
first was Katsuhito and Washu, then Sasami, and Ryo-oki,
finally Tenchi with Ryoko, and Ayeka in each arm headed for the cave,
leaving Nobuyuki, and Mihoshi to walk by themselves.
What they didn't know was tat all of them headed to the cave and
a portal setup by Washu which took them to an observation room with a Video
feed of Achika's grave.
Now Katsuhito was told of the plan only an hour before dinner by Washu.
So he was the most hesitant of all about pushing these two together.
So he wasn't to keen on spying on them at his own daughter's grave.
But, he didn't stop it either.
He was also curious about the pair, and wanted to see for himself if this
friendship was true.

As they all watched, Nobuyuki, and Mihoshi sat down on their knees,
and said a Shinto prayer to honor his now departed wife. Nobuyuki then
started talking to the grave stone.
"Well where to begin? Ah, yes dear did you know that Mihoshi her has an
engineering degree from the
Galactic Science Academy?" Mihoshi could only just blush! The others sat
there with opened mouths, Shocked.
Mihoshi, ....an engineer??!? was all they thought about as Nobuyuki
continued.
"She's been a great help in finalizing my plans, and since this is a 9-5
type of job,
I asked my boss if we could employee Mihoshi as my assistant."
He paused to look at her, she smiled her radiant smile to him.
I am going to ask Little Washu for help in providing the proper
documentation,
and If Mihoshi accepts,  it means she'll be working with me and
can still do her patrol work while here on earth. Now doesn't it sound
great, dear?"
Mihoshi then took his hand and squeezed, she shook her head yes!

"Mihoshi's ....and Engineer??! was all Washu did as the others observed the
now happy couple.
"Nubi, ... do you rally think Achika would approve us working together?"
asked a now hesitant Mihoshi.
Now we have talked up here in front of her grave for three weeks now,
I think if she had not accepted us being friends, she would have found a
way to tell us!" was all Nobuyuki could say.
"She does not object!" came an ethereal voice from behind them.
Who are..." was all He said as they came upon the form of Tsunami,
floating just a few inches off the ground in a translucent type form!

"TSSSunami?!?" was all He said
"Yes oh noble Nobuyuki." she replied
"Oh goody, I get to see you as Sasami will be when she grows up. Gosh, you
sure a pretty!"
was all Mihoshi said like a school girl meeting her idol.
"Well, thank you Mihoshi, I will convey your good feelings to Sasami.
(Who at that time was sleeping in washu's lab as the rest of the household
stood still and observed the three conversing.)
""
"So, if I may be so Bold, why did you say she does not object?" Asked a now
curious Nobuyuki.
"Well, as you know I am a goddess. So, I can contact people ...who have
passed on ... in a limited way.
Especially those from the Royal Family."
It dawned on Nobuyuki, and Mihoshi that Achika was Katsuhito's daughter,
therefore she was A Jurian Princess.

"So, she approves of us working together?" asked Mihoshi rather meekly.
"I can say she does, ... and what's more, she wants you two ...together."

"WHAT?!?"

Was said by Nobuyuki, and Mihoshi, as well as in Washu's lab by the rest of
the family.

"What do you mean by that?" was all Nobuyuki could say.

"She knows your both lonely, and she wants you two ... together in this
life!" was all Tsunami said until she disappeared in front of them.

Both looked stunned! They had heard it from Tsunami, that Achika not only
approved of their friendship,
...but of going further than that!


______________________________________________________________________________________________

Feelings are Realized

Then both looked at each other ...in a new light Nobuyuki, and Mihoshi then
took each other's hand
and slowly they hugged eah other. Now they hugged before ...as friends, but
now it was ... diffeent.
They felt the heat of each others body, and they kept looking at each
other's eyes.
Mihoshi then closed her eyes and snuggled into his arms, he simply smiled
and kept her there.
As both held on to each other both ran what was said to them by Tsunami
over in their heads.
Did both want ... more than friendship?
Did they care more of each other as friends, or ...what?
They finally looked downinto each other's eyes again, this time something
different was felt by both.

Then without hesitation, ... they kissed!

Not a butterfly kiss nor a passionate kiss, but a kiss filled with
affection for each other
and a twinkling of feeling both had at that moment in their hearts.

Yes! It could be ...more!

They kissed some more in the same caring way and when they parted, smiles
were on their faced a yard wide!

They knew then that they wouldn;t be the same again!

______________________________________________________________________________________________

Is it ... love?

As they walked down the path towards their home, they saw through the glass
patio doors
everyone pile out of Washu's lab entrance. all semed to have large sweat
drops as they made their way inside.
Nobuyuki, and Mihoshi then asked fot quiet and they then said to the
family;
Mihoshi and I have decided to ... date!" was all Nobuyuki said as all the
family smiled in approving fashion.
Mihoshi was red as a tomato as she stood by Nonuyuki holding his hand.

As the weeks when by the two grew closer and it became more clear to all
that they were detined to marry.
Even Tenchi and Katsuhito who were the most hesitant of all about the two
for the memory of Achika still burned brightly in their hearts,
saw the genuine affection  and love they had for each other.
Then finally 3 months after Mihoshi had trailed Nobuyuki to his wife grave,

did Nobuyuki propose to her in front of the whole family.
But as the celebration had commenced Mihoshi's bracelet started beeping.
She looked very dispontant but smiled and told the rest of her family
that she'd find out what was happening and would be back as soon as
possible!
Then, surprising all there, she passionately Kissed her husband to be
alsmost snapping his back in the classic
kissing bent backwards scene like in the movies and then she phazed out of
sight, trnsported to her GP shuttle.
______________________________________________________________________________________________

A call

About twenty minutes later Mihoshi appeared.
She was, crying, and collapsed on her knees!

Nobuyuki ran to her and gathered her in his arms and walked her to the
couch.
The rest of the faily gathered around to help if they could and find out
what had happened.

After she calmed down, Mihoshi began to explain what had happened.
She was being ...reassigned to headqarters.
It seems that someone (A lord Kito) in the Jurai High council had requested
that only Jurai knights
should be on earth to protect the Royals living there, so there should be
no GP officers within that solar system.

It seems that someone was trying to use Mihoshi and the rest oin a
powerplay situation back on Jurai.
Well it didn;t take long for Ayeka and Sasami to contact their parents and
inform them of what was going on.
At first The Emperor was indifferent to Mihoshui's plight,
that is until his wives reminded him that Nobuyuki was now part of the
Royal family by marriage, and that If he married Mihoshi she wouldn't have
to leave.
Those who were on earth didn't know what was going on back on Jurai,
they just resented being used as pawns in this.
So eventually  things were straightened out, and to ensure tha there would
be no more interference,
Nobuyuki, and Mihoshi set the wedding date to next week!
As all prepared for the nuptuals, a certain someone Lord Kito,now formally
of the Jurai Council,
was headed to earth with one thought in mind, Kill Nobuyuki, and Mihoshi
and hold the rest of the Royals there to force the Emperor off the throne!

Chapter #3 : Final Act

We'll see what happens as Kito and his forces attack and find out
ifNobuyuki, and Mihoshi can finally find happiness!
