"On the Road Again"

TEASER

FADE IN:

INT. Yukinojo's bridge – DAY (Monday, 27 April 1998; 25th Day, 2nd Month)

Washu sits in the command chair.

Mihoshi and Kazuhiko, hand in hand, walk in.

MIHOSHI
Hello Ms. Washu.

KAZUHIKO
Hello Little Washu.

WASHU
Hello you two.  Have you sent your report yet Mihoshi?

MIHOSHI
That is what I came up here for.

WASHU
Can I read it before you send it?

Mihoshi looks embarrassed.

Kazuhiko starts chuckling.

MIHOSHI
Well you can't really read my report.

WASHU
Why not?

MIHOSHI
I don't write reports.  If I did I would not have time for anything else.

WASHU
So do you dictate them then?

MIHOSHI
You could say that.

Kazuhiko loses it and is bent over laughing.

WASHU
What is so funny?

KAZUHIKO
I have watched Mihoshi give her reports.  You won't be able to get
anything out of her Little Washu.

WASHU
Why?

KAZUHIKO
Every report she sends is the same ten words.  First she says, "It is
time for my report."  Then she closes her eyes and after awhile she says,
"that concludes my report."

WASHU
You project your report with your thoughts?

MIHOSHI
Yes.  I do have a lot of stuff to report.

Washu calls up her keyboard.

She types a few commands.

Her floating camera appears.

WASHU
This I got to see.

Mihoshi sits in the other command chair.

MIHOSHI
It is time for my report.

Mihoshi closes her eyes.

Washu and Kazuhiko watch.

WASHU
How long can this take?

KAZUHIKO
Sometimes a few minutes and once it took forty-five minutes.

Both watch Mihoshi.

MIHOSHI
That concludes my report.

YUKINOJO
Thank you Mihoshi.

Washu looks at her keyboard readout.

WASHU
I waited fifty minutes for this.  Damn!  It was to fast for me to catch.

MIHOSHI
What is wrong Ms. Washu?

WASHU
Oh, nothing.  Please call me before you send your next report.

MIHOSHI
I'll try to remember that.  Are you making supper tonight Kazuhiko?

KAZUHIKO
Yes.  I am cooking lamb tonight.

WASHU
Where did you get lamb?

KAZUHIKO
Ship's stores.  There are all kinds of stuff in there.

WASHU
I can believe that.

ACT ONE

FADE IN:

INT. Master bedroom – DAY

Tenchi and Sasami walk in hand in hand.

They move over to the bed.

Sasami sits on the bed while Tenchi remains standing.

SASAMI
What's wrong Tenchi?

TENCHI
I don't feel right about this.

SASAMI
We're betrothed.

TENCHI
We aren't married yet.

SASAMI
So act like we are on a date.

Tenchi blushes

SASAMI
What's wrong now?

TENCHI
I don't have much experience on dating.  I didn't have to date Ryoko and
Ayeka, and I hadn't started dating when all of you showed up.  My life
has been running full speed and I can't find the brake.

SASAMI
I'm sorry Tenchi.  I guess we have been thinking about ourselves.
I thought you were enjoying your time with us.

TENCHI
Oh, I have enjoyed it.  Who would think that a boy from Okayama could
have ruled the universe?  That I would fall in love with so many
beautiful women?  I'm in space.  Most people can only dream of that.

SASAMI
Today you can start a new life with me.  Just forget about how young
I look.  Think of what I will look like in the near future.

TENCHI
I am.  You will look like the reflection we saw.  What has happened to
you?  Why did this happen?

SASAMI
That is a story I would like to tell once.  I'll tell it at dinner
tonight.

TENCHI
Are you cooking?

SASAMI
Not tonight.  We're going to spend some time together.

TENCHI
Are you putting your past behind you?  Are you finished with the cooking
and cleaning?  You've spent a lot of your time just waiting on our
needs.  I can understand that…

SASAMI (overlapping)
No Tenchi.  I love to do those things.  It makes me happy and it makes
those around me happy.  Some things will change.  You'll understand
after dinner.

Tenchi sits down next to her.

TENCHI
I love you Sasami.  It is a different love than I have for Ayeka and
Ryoko, but I love each of them differently too.

SASAMI
I understand Tenchi.  I just want you to relax and enjoy the moment.

Tenchi kisses her.

SASAMI
Thank you.  That means a lot to me.

TENCHI
Tell me about growing up on Jurai.

SASAMI
Okay.

INT. Dining room – DAY

Grandfather sits at the end nearest the kitchen.  To Grandfather's right
sit Ayeka, and Ryoko.  To his left sit Washu, Ryo-Ohki in her girl form,
Daijiro, and Ryoe.

Sasami and Tenchi walk in hand in hand.

Tenchi sits between Ayeka and Ryoko, and Sasami sits between Washu and
Ryo-Ohki.

TENCHI
It's good to see you Ryoe, Daijiro.

DAIJIRO
Thank you Tenchi.  We had a rough day yesterday.

RYOE
That's an understatement!  I can't believe that I had to watch you get
shot again.

DAIJIRO
At least this time it didn't cost me my memories.

TENCHI
Sometimes we have to take the little victories.  Does Kazuhiko have
cooking detail again?

WASHU
Well if Sasami isn't cooking who else would you trust to make a meal.

AYEKA
I did take a year of cooking in school Ms. Washu.  I ensure you that
I can cook something edible.

RYOKO
That's right mom.  I don't see you in the kitchen.

WASHU
Why should I limit myself to such primitive devices that are in the
kitchen?

SASAMI
You both did take cooking in school.  Maybe we need to divide up the
cooking like the rest of the chores in this house.

TENCHI
That's a great idea Sasami.

RYOE
Is there a reason why Sasami has been doing all the cooking?

WASHU
Yes, I only have so many antidotes.

AYEKA
Well you must be speaking about your daughter.

RYOKO
Ayeka!  I graduated too you know.

Kazuhiko and Mihoshi come out of the kitchen with dinner.

They set the dishes on the table.

Kazuhiko sits at the end opposite Grandfather, and Mihoshi sits to
Ryoko's right.

KAZUHIKO
Are we trying to decide who is the best cook?  If that's true then
Sasami wins hands down.

SASAMI
Thank you Kazuhiko.  Your cooking is very good also.

KAZUHIKO
Well I took two years of classes with Ms. Makiko.

DAIJIRO
I thought you took those classes to meet girls.

KAZUHIKO
That is why I signed up, but soon I found that I was enjoying myself.
If wrestling hadn't entered my life I would've become a chef.  My father
would've made it a military chef if he had his way.

TENCHI
Well with this lamb you made I'm glad you joined with us.

SASAMI
Yes Kazuhiko, this is very good.

KAZUHIKO
Thank you.

RYOKO
Ms. Makiko was the nicest teacher in the school.

AYEKA
You only say that because she would always try your cooking.

RYOKO
You didn't exactly win any prizes.

AYEKA
That's true.  I didn't have any dishes named after me.

RYOKO
Ayeka!  We agreed not to talk about that.

SASAMI
You had a dish named after you Ryoko?

Ryoko drops her head to the table.

AYEKA
Most of her dishes were named after her.  Of course they all had the
same name.

Ryoko is slowly pounding her head against the table.

KAZUHIKO
What were they called?

AYEKA
Ryoko's surprise.

The group starts laughing.

RYOKO
It's not funny.

AYEKA
Ms. Makiko would try every one of her dishes even though she was sent to
the hospital twice.

A loud crack.

The table is split in two.

Ryoko has her head against the floor.

RYOKO
Oops.

Everyone, except Ryoko, is laughing now.

Ryoko starts to cry.

TENCHI
Stop!

The room goes silent except for Ryoko's crying.

TENCHI
It'is because we love you that we can joke about your cooking.  Do you
remember how good those rice balls you made for me were?

AYEKA
You did win a prize for that sake steamed sole you made.  They called it
Ryoko's surprise surprised.

Ryoko stops crying and looks up.

RYOKO
I think that recipe called for three tablespoons of sake.  I drank the
rest.

WASHU
That explains why you won.  You must cook better drunk.

Everyone begins laughing again with Ryoko joining in.

INT. Dining room – DAY

The meal is finished and Mihoshi and Ryoe stand to clear the dishes.

SASAMI
Please sit back down Mihoshi, Ryoe.

Both sit back down.

SASAMI
Yesterday something happened that has changed my life forever.  Now is
the time for me to tell you about it.

Everyone gives Sasami their attention.

SASAMI
It happened 710 years ago when Kagato attacked Jurai.

Ryoko lowers her head and begins to cry.

SASAMI
Cheer up Ryoko.  You are not to blame for this.

RYOKO
I hurt you then and I hurt you again yesterday.

SASAMI
Then you almost killed me, and I've forgiven you for that.  I'll accept
responsibility for my own actions yesterday, thank you.

Ryoko looks up at Sasami.

RYOKO
Thank you sister.

SASAMI
I was playing in the Life Tree temple when the attack occurred.  An
explosion rocked the building sending me to the bottom.  I survived the
fall but I lay there bleeding to death.  Then I felt Tsunami's presence.

Sasami's flashback.

INT. Bottom of the Jurai Life Tree temple – DAY

Sasami lays bleeding on a rock.

Her blood runs into the water.

Her astral projection stands on the rock crying as she looks at her
broken body.

RYOKO (O. C.)
Wow! That's like what I did to watch Tenchi grow up.

INT. Dining room – DAY

The group sits around the table.

AYEKA
Ryoko it would be easier to listen to the story if you would stop
interrupting.

RYOKO
Well excuse me for having a life.

AYEKA
What do you mean by that!

TENCHI
Stop it you two.  Please go on with your story Sasami.

Ryoko and Ayeka both look down.

RYOKO and AYEKA
Sorry Tenchi.

SASAMI
Okay.  Anyway I noticed that there was another presence in the temple.

Sasami's flashback.

INT. Bottom of the Jurai Life Tree temple – DAY

Sasami lays bleeding on a rock.

Her blood runs into the water.

Her astral projection stands on the rock crying as she looks at her
broken body.

The astral Sasami looks up.

INT. Bottom of the Jurai Life Tree temple – DAY

Tsunami stands before her life tree.

TSUNAMI
Why do you cry little one?

INT. Bottom of the Jurai Life Tree temple – DAY

Show both Tsunami and Sasami.

SASAMI
Who are you?

TSUNAMI
I am the one that created the Jurai people.  I am Tsunami.

SASAMI
I'm scared.  Help me please.

TSUNAMI
I am sorry little one.  I cannot help you.

SASAMI
Please!  I'm dying!

TSUNAMI
Death is a part of life little one.

Tsunami turns her back on Sasami and moves toward her tree.

SASAMI
No, don't leave me!

Tsunami ignores her.

She reaches out to her tree.

SASAMI
No!

Sasami's astral body runs across the water and grabs Tsunami's cloak.

Tsunami turns around with a kind expression on her face.

TSUNAMI
I cannot interfere with this reality.  Please let me go.

SASAMI
No!  I will not let you go!  You must help me now!

Sasami grabs at Tsunami and passes into her.

Tsunami's face takes on a shocked expression.

TSUNAMI
What have you done child?

Sasami on the rock coughs and sits up.

SASAMI
Who are you?

Tsunami crosses the water to stand next to Sasami.

TSUNAMI
I am Tsunami.  Who are you?

SASAMI
I'm Sasami, and I'm scared.

Tsunami nods her head.

She lays her hand on Sasami's face.

TSUNAMI
Hush little one.  You are safe now.

Sasami lies back down and closes her eyes.

Tsunami picks her up and floats to the top of the temple.

She lays Sasami down in front of the door and disappears.

Sasami wakes up.

SASAMI
Mommy!   Mommy, where are you.

Sasami stands and runs to the door.

SASAMI
I'm scared mommy.

Sasami opens the door to see her mother in the hall.

Sasami runs to her mother.

INT. Dining room – Night

Everyone is still seated at the table.

Sasami is looking down.

SASAMI
At first I thought I dreamed the whole thing.  I kept having flashbacks
to a life I never lived.  It scared me.

Sasami looks up at Ayeka.

SASAMI
Many times I'd try to tell you Ayeka.  You were always so busy.

AYEKA
I'm sorry Sasami.

SASAMI
Well you were training to be princess.  Then it came crashing down on me
at the spa.  I really thought I died on Jurai and I was a new creation
of Tsunami's.  I thought I was like you Ryoko.  I had something of a
mother and no real father.

Ryoko reaches across the table and takes Washu's hand.

RYOKO
I've found out I have a real mother, and I don't miss that blob that was
my dad.

SASAMI
Then that time Tenchi almost died fighting Kagato.  I went to
Grandfather's life tree and prayed to Tsunami.  She granted my request
and saved Tenchi from a cold death in space.  It cost me though.  I was
filled with Tsunami like the time in the temple.  All that was me was
shoved into a corner in my mind.

Tenchi reaches across the table and touches Sasami's cheek.

TENCHI
Thank you for saving me Sasami.

Sasami holds his hand.

She turns her head and kisses his palm.

SASAMI
Little Washu helped a lot with that talk we had.  My dreams were scaring
me so much that I didn't want to sleep.  She made me feel better, and
I was beginning to think it was all a dream again.

Sasami lets go of Tenchi's hand.

SASAMI
I next met Tsunami when I generated the Wings of the Light Hawk for the
first time.  I realized that I could reach across time and space to talk
with her.  That's when I knew that I didn't die in the temple.  I stole
part of her life force.  I was just a scared little girl and took what
I needed to live.

AYEKA
Surely she didn't blame you for that.

Sasami
She was surprised that I could do it at all.  She had underestimated my
true power.

WASHU
Just what is your true power?

SASAMI
I'm still learning that day to day.  Take my cooking for example.
I know what each of you like.  I can flavor a dish so that each of you
tastes what is best in it.  I have an empathy with everyone here.

MIHOSHI
So is that why you make everyone so happy.

SASAMI
It's how I can make people happy.  I do it because it makes me happy
when you are happy.

TENCHI
Is Tsunami forcing you to do any of this?

SASAMI
No, she can't force me because she isn't here.  What I took from her was
her essence, and I have all of her memories.

Washu's face shows a shocked expression.

WASHU
How far back do those memories go?

SASAMI
To the beginning of time Little Washu.

WASHU
Can you…

SASAMI (overlapping)
No, I can't tell you of your past.  I may not be bound by the same
restrictions that hold Tsunami's tongue, but I will not betray her.
She loves you Little Washu, and that is all I will say on that matter.

Washu looks down.

Sasami hugs Washu.

SASAMI
My problem is that I now know too much about each of you.  Things
I wished I didn't know.

Everyone's face saddens by this except Grandfather's

Grandfather's face shows shock.

TENCHI
How recent are your memories.

SASAMI
Each time I contact Tsunami she updates my memories.

AYEKA
Can you avoid contacting her?

SASAMI
Can you avoid breathing?

Ayeka looks down.

SASAMI
I'm sorry sister.  That was uncalled for.  I feel like I'm trying to
find someone to blame for what happened to me.  In the end I can only
blame myself.

GRANDFATHER
Sasami?

SASAMI
I have always been able to keep secrets Grandfather.  Now I keep them
because I love everyone here so much that I will not hurt any of you.

GRANDFATHER
Thank you sister.

WASHU
Sasami can I, ah…

SASAMI
Yes Little Washu you can keep running tests on me.  Only when I say stop
you will listen to me.

Washu smiles and blushes.

SASAMI
Now for the changes.  We will split up the cooking.  I 'd like to cook
all the meals one day a week, and I pick Sunday.  I'll always help
anyone in the kitchen.  If you have the cooking duty you will clean the
kitchen.

Sasami stares at Ryoko.

SASAMI
I expect everyone to do their household chores.  Again if you need help
I'll be happy to help you.

RYOKO
Yes Sasami.

Sasami laughs.

SASAMI
Well I see who has the guilty conscience.  Finally whatever Tenchi and
me do on our time is our business.  It's no one else's.  Is that
understood?

Tenchi blushes.

EVERYONE
Yes Sasami.

SASAMI
Any questions.

Everyone shakes their head.

SASAMI
When I learn more about my powers, like my ability to heal, I'll let you
know.  It has grown late and I'm ready for bed.

Sasami stands and walks around the table.

She takes Tenchi's hand and he stands.

As they walk past Mihoshi Sasami reaches out and touches her cheek.

MIHOSHI
What is it?  What did I do?

SASAMI
Thank you Mihoshi.  Thank you for everything you have ever done.

Sasami and Tenchi leave the room.

Mihoshi holds her hand to her face.

Everyone is looking at her.

MIHOSHI
Everyone is looking at me.  Does that mean?

Everyone grows intense in their stares.

MIHOSHI
Could it be that?

EVERYONE
Yes.

MIHOSHI
Do I have food on my face?

The group falls over.

INT. Hallway – NIGHT

Sasami and Tenchi come up the stairs hand in hand.

SASAMI
You go on ahead Tenchi.

Sasami enters her old bedroom.

Tenchi continues down the hall.

INT. Master bedroom – NIGHT

Tenchi enters the room.

He undresses down to his boxers.

Tenchi gets into bed.

TENCHI (expressed as thought)
What am I doing?  She is still too young to be sleeping in the same bed
with me.  It was okay when she would take the bed and I would take the
futon.  What am I going to do?

Tenchi drifts off to sleep.

Sasami enters the room.

She is wearing her pajamas.

She gets into bed to Tenchi's right, and kisses him on the lips.

She holds the kiss.

Tenchi wakes up gasping for air.

TENCHI
Sasami!

SASAMI
Did you like that Tenchi?

TENCHI
Ah…  Ah…  Ah…

SASAMI
You do sound like my sister when she talks about sex.

TENCHI
Sasami, it's just that…  Well you are so…

SASAMI
Young.

TENCHI
Yes.  I'm sorry, I don't want to hurt you, and I don't want to do
something that will make me hate myself.

SASAMI
I understand.  Maybe this will help.

Sasami takes a far away look.

TENCHI
What?

TSUNAMI (O. C.)
Hello Tenchi.

INT. Master bedroom – NIGHT

Tenchi and Sasami are in bed.

Tsunami stands next to the bed on the side away from Sasami.

Tenchi turns and looks at Tsunami.

TENCHI
Tsunami?

Tenchi looks at Sasami.

TENCHI
How did she get here?

SASAMI
I told you I could reach across time and space and call her.

TSUNAMI
So here I am.  Am I old enough for you Tenchi?

TENCHI
What?!

TSUNAMI
I thought you liked twosomes.

TENCHI
Ah…  Ah…  Ah…

TSUNAMI
You are right Sasami.  He does sound like Ayeka.

TENCHI
What's going on here?  Are you really here Tsunami?  Did Sasami force
you to come?

SASAMI
I only called out to her.

TSUNAMI
Yes I am really here, and do you believe that Sasami could force a
goddess to do anything?  Before Sasami I could not leave Jurai.  Now
I can go anywhere at anytime.  I have chosen to be here because Sasami
is sad.

TENCHI
I'm sorry Sasami.  I don't mean to make you sad.  I just don't know what
to do.

Tsunami's clothes change into pajamas.

TSUNAMI
I would recommend a good nights sleep.

Tsunami gets into bed and kisses Tenchi.

TSUNAMI
Good night Tenchi.

Tsunami rolls on her side with her back to Tenchi.

SASAMI
I should have told you earlier.  With me you get Tsunami.  Whenever we
meet she knows everything I know, and I know everything she knows.

TENCHI
Tsunami, I can't…

TSUNAMI
No one expects you to.

Sasami kisses Tenchi.

SASAMI
Good night Tenchi.

Sasami rolls on her side with her back to Tenchi.

TENCHI (expressed as thought)
How will I explain this to my other wives?  I can't explain it to myself.

Tenchi closes his eyes.

FADE OUT:

END ACT ONE



ACT TWO

FADE IN:

INT. Master bedroom; Close up of Tenchi's face – DAY (Tuesday, 28 April
1998; 26th Day, 2nd Month)

Tenchi lies on his back.

Tenchi opens his eyes.

He rolls his head to the right.

INT. Master bedroom; Close up of Tenchi and Sasami's face – DAY

Sasami lies on her side facing Tenchi.

SASAMI
Good morning Tenchi.

Tenchi kisses Sasami.

TENCHI
Good morning Sasami

Tenchi rolls his head to the left.

INT. Master bedroom; Close up of Tenchi and Tsunami's face – DAY

Tsunami lies on her side facing Tenchi.

TSUNAMI
Good morning Tenchi.

Tenchi kisses Tsunami.

TENCHI
Good morning Tsunami.

Tenchi looks back up at the ceiling.

INT. Master bedroom – DAY

Tenchi lies in the middle on his back.

To his right lies Sasami on her side facing him.

To his left lies Tsunami on her side facing him.

TENCHI
I feel positively wicked laying here with the two of you.

SASAMI
I don't remember doing anything wicked.

TENCHI
You didn't have my dreams.

Sasami blushes.

SASAMI
I don't think there was anything wicked in my dreams.

TSUNAMI
There was in mine.

TENCHI
Tsunami, are you here as a friend?

TSUNAMI
Yes Tenchi.  Did you think I had other reasons?

TENCHI
Truthfully, no.  I'm not very good at dealing with people that are out
for themselves.  I'm glad you aren't one of them.

Tenchi stares at the ceiling lost in thought.

SASAMI
What are you thinking about?

TENCHI
What do I tell Ayeka and Ryoko?

TSUNAMI
I do not plan on being discovered by anyone here, nor do I expect you to
tell them of my presence.

TENCHI
You don't know Little Washu very well.

TSUNAMI
I know her better than she knows herself.  I disabled all of her spy
devices before I appeared and I sealed the room from normal and sub
space.

SASAMI
Devices?

TSUNAMI
She has several around the house and ship.

SASAMI
I knew that.  I just didn't think of it.

Tsunami raises up on her elbow.

TSUNAMI
You may have my memories but there is a lot of information, and you will
have to learn how to sort it all out.

SASAMI
Aren't you upset by that Tenchi?

TENCHI
No I am flattered by Little Washu's attention.  I knew she spied on
everyone.  I've always found her to be very discreet.  Although I don't
know how much information Grandfather can get out of her.

TSUNAMI
What do you think of that pairing?

Tenchi chuckles.

TENCHI
Washu is enjoying the hunt, and I think Grandfather is enjoying being
chased.  Some day she will catch him though.  On that day she will find
out she has more than she ever bargained for.

Both Sasami and Tsunami laugh.

TENCHI
Shall we see who drew the short straw and is making breakfast this
morning?

SASAMI
I would rather snuggle up to you all day, but I don't want you to faint
from hunger.

Tenchi and Sasami get out of bed.

Tsunami observes them from the bed.

Tenchi gets dressed while Sasami goes into the bathroom.

Sasami comes out of the bathroom dressed.

TENCHI
Good bye Tsunami.  I look forward to seeing you again.

Tenchi and Sasami leave the room.

Tsunami lays on her back and sighs.

She disappears.

INT. Dining room – DAY

Tenchi and Sasami enter the dining room.

Voices can be heard from the kitchen.

Tenchi and Sasami stand at the dining room entrance and listen.

RYOKO (O. C.)
Damn it Ayeka, what in the hell are you doing?

AYEKA (O. C.)
At least I am not burning anything!

RYOKO (O. C.)
What?  Can you still smell it?  I thought I got it all out of the house.

WASHU (O. C.)
You two are hopeless.  What did they teach you at that school?

RYOKO (O. C.)
I would say about as much as you know.

AYEKA (O. C.)
Taste this Washu.

RYOKO (O. C.)
Let me taste it too.

WASHU (O. C.)
Not bad Ayeka.  Let's quit while we are ahead.

RYOKO (O. C.)
Damn it I can't tell anything.  Why did you screw up my taste buds mom?

WASHU (O. C.)
I didn't want you to grow up with my cooking, and if I fix them you'll
just say everything tastes like chicken.

RYOKO (O. C.)
Very funny.  With what Kagato fed me it's probably for the best.

Tenchi pulls Sasami out of the dining room.

Ryoko, Ayeka, and Washu enter the dining room.

They set the table.

Tenchi and Sasami enter the dining room.

TENCHI
Good morning girls.  Something smells good.

SASAMI
Thank you for making breakfast this morning.

AYEKA
It was no trouble really.

Ryoe and Daijiro enter the dining room.

Mihoshi and Kazuhiko enter the dining room.

TENCHI
Where's Grandfather?

WASHU
He's meditating right now.  I'll bring him something later.

Everyone starts to eat except Ayeka and Ryoko.

Tenchi and Sasami look at each other.

TENCHI
Thank you, the breakfast is fine.

SASAMI
I am glad to see that you did learn something from school.

Ayeka and Ryoko start eating.

TENCHI
So Little Washu, how are things going in the lab.  Haven't had any
equipment problems have you.

Washu, Ayeka, and Ryoko turn a deep red.

WASHU
So nice of you to ask.  You know me always one or two bugs to work out.

Tenchi and Sasami share a laugh.

DAIJIRO
How are things working out for you Tenchi?

TENCHI
I can't complain.  Would you and Ryoe like to go back down to the planet?

RYOE
No thank you.  I've put this place behind me now.  We can move forward
with our life.

DAIJIRO
How much longer will we be here?

WASHU
I'll be finished by noon today.  I've captured a total of six men
besides the one Mihoshi brought back.  I've also recovered thirty-four
weapons.

TENCHI
Good.  I'm ready to go home.

Everyone nods their head.

INT. Family room – NIGHT (Sunday, 3 May 1998; 1st Day, 3rd Month)

Tenchi, Kazuhiko, Daijiro, and Grandfather sit at the table playing
Mahjongg.

Ayeka, Ryoko, Sasami, Ryo-Ohki, Ryoe, Mihoshi, and Washu sit watching
television.

A romance drama is on the TV.

The show ends.

TENCHI
I'm going to sleep in your old room tonight Sasami.

SASAMI
Why Tenchi?

TENCHI
The bed in my room can easily hold three people.

Ayeka, Ryoko, and Sasami all turn red.

AYEKA
What are you implying Tenchi.

TENCHI
It's my night off.  I though you could use the space.  It has to be
better than sleeping on futons in your old room.

RYOKO
I like the idea.

AYEKA
You would.

RYOKO
Hey!  What do you mean by that!

SASAMI
As long as Ryoko is in the middle it's okay with me.

RYOKO
Why do you want me in the middle?

SASAMI
You know how Ayeka throws her elbows.

Ryoko laughs.

AYEKA
I do not!

RYOKO
Tenchi will tell us the truth.

TENCHI
I'm busy right now.  Can't talk.  It's your move Kazuhiko.

Ayeka's face shows shock.

AYEKA
Well we'll see who has the bruises in the morning.

Ayeka walks out of the room.

Ryoko and Sasami look at each other and smile.

They follow Ayeka.

RYOE
How do you do it Tenchi?

Tenchi turns red.

Daijiro and Kazuhiko start laughing.

DAIJIRO
Let me guess.  You just ignore them until they make the decision they
wanted anyway.

KAZUHIKO
Or you just say yes.

TENCHI
I let them do what they want.  Then I may have a chance to get what
I want when I surprise them with a request.

GRANDFATHER
It is the tree that bends that remains standing after the storm.

WASHU
Spouting philosophy in your old age Grandfather?

GRANDFATHER
Someone of your learning should be able to recognize something she
created.

Grandfather casually ducks the pillow aimed for his head.

Mihoshi changes the TV to the all cartoon channel.

MIHOSHI
Would you like a cookie Ms. Washu?

WASHU
What?

MIHOSHI
I'll be happy to get back.  I'd like some fresh air.

Washu shakes her head.

WASHU
I'll be in my lab if anyone needs me.

Washu leaves the room.

The men continue their game while Mihoshi, Ryo-Ohki, and Ryoe watch
television.

INT. Washu's lab – DAY (Monday, 18 May 1998; 16th Day, 3rd Month)

Washu sits on her floating pillow at her keyboard.

She is in casual dress.

The crab alarm sounds.

Washu turns in her seat.

INT. Door to Washu's lab – DAY

Sasami is standing by the door.

The door disappears.

Sasami approaches Washu.

INT. Washu's lab – DAY

Sasami stands in front of Washu.

WASHU
Good morning Sasami.  Can I help you?

SASAMI
Good morning Little Washu, and yes you can.  I'd like for you to turn
off your monitoring devices in Grandfather's room and study.

Washu blushes.

She types some commands on her keyboard.

WASHU
Done.  May I ask why?

SASAMI
Over the last few years he has been more of a father to me than Azusa
ever was.  I'd like some private and personal time with him so that we
can talk.

WASHU
How did you…

SASAMI (overlapping)
Tenchi told me about the devices.

Washu's face falls.

WASHU
Is he angry?

SASAMI
Remember when we came downstairs and he asked if anything had broken
lately.  Just before that he told me about how you spied on everyone all
the time.

WASHU
Oh god!  What will I do now?

SASAMI
Carry on as usual.  I was mad at first when he told me.  He was
flattered and amused by your attention.  Everything started working
again later, right?  He said that you were very discreet, and I trust
him on this.  I won't tell anyone else.  No telling what Ayeka would
do if she found out.

Washu turns a deep red.

WASHU
Then why the secrecy when talking to Grandfather.

Sasami reaches out and touches Washu's cheek.

SASAMI
You could be a beautiful woman Washu.

WASHU
It has been to long since I wanted to be an adult.

SASAMI
Oh, really?

Washu blushes again.

WASHU
Since I wanted to be an adult all the time.

Sasami smiles.

SASAMI
He's your second love.

WASHU
Yes, and I don't want this to end like my first.

		SASAMI
Tenchi talked to Grandfather about you.

WASHU
Oh.

SASAMI
Tenchi told Grandfather that he would be upset if Grandfather did
anything to hurt you.  Grandfather took that very seriously.

WASHU
Maybe I should have stayed in contention to be his third wife.

SASAMI
I don't know what I'd have done if you did that.  Besides you need to
know how Tenchi sees you.  He loves you as his daughter.

WASHU
Daughter!?

SASAMI
Think of how you love Ryoko.  That will give you an idea how Tenchi
feels about you.

Washu sits back and thinks about that for a few moments.

WASHU
My guinea pig just loves messing with my mind.

Both share a laugh.

WASHU
I guess right now I look like the daughter he dreamed about.

SASAMI
He has felt this way long before the dream.  He loves you Washu.  He
will always love you no matter what path you choose.

WASHU
Thank you Sasami.  There's someone who misses you.  She's afraid she no
longer has a place in your life.

SASAMI
Ryo-Ohki?

Washu nods her head.

SASAMI
She almost always spends her time in her human form.  I guess I've been
very busy lately.  You've been taking care of her?

WASHU
Of course.  I can't let one of my daughters suffer.

SASAMI
How long will you continue to suffer?

WASHU
For as long as it takes to atone for what I've done.

SASAMI
Five thousand years?  She has already forgiven you.  The other night she
said she had found her real mother.  Let it go Little Washu.

WASHU
Is that Tsunami speaking or you?

SASAMI
I may have her memories but I can only speak for myself.  I love you too
Little Washu.

WASHU
I would still like to know why Tsunami loves me?

Sasami starts to sing Washu's lullaby.

Washu joins in after a couple verses.

Washu stops after the line "The world was born."

Sasami pauses and smiles at Washu.

She then continues singing the song from that point.

Washu listens.

Sasami sings the line "My sweet Washu."

WASHU (overlapping)
Wait!  Was Tsunami my mother?

SASAMI
No, she wasn't your mother.  She did raise you when you were a baby.

WASHU
Do you know who my mother was?

SASAMI
No.

WASHU
You don't know or Tsunami doesn't know?

SASAMI
We don't know.  I'm sorry.

WASHU
That's okay.  I'll keep searching.

SASAMI
I wish you well Little Washu.  May you find happiness.

Washu
Thank you Sasami.  Later can you teach me the whole lullaby?

Sasami nods her head and leaves the lab.

Washu sits on her pillow staring off into space.

INT. Grandfather's study – DAY

Grandfather sits before the shrine praying.

A knock on the door.

GRANDFATHER
Come in.

Sasami enters the room carrying a tray.

A teapot and cups along with cakes are on the tray.

Sasami walks over to the table and sets down the tray.

She kneels by the table and pours tea.

SASAMI
Won't you join me Yoshou?

Grandfather kneels across the table from Sasami and takes some tea.

SASAMI
How long will you keep up this pretence?  Are you trying to atone for
your sins?

GRANDFATHER
What do you mean Sasami?

Sasami waves her hand at Grandfather.

SASAMI
This sham.

GRANDFATHER
Funaho?

SASAMI
Your mother would never betray you Yoshou.  She'll love you no matter
what you may do.

GRANDFATHER
Tsunami?

SASAMI
Don't blame her Yoshou.  I stole her memories with out her permission.
I know that as long as your Life Tree, Funaho, flourishes so will you.

GRANDFATHER
It has been too long Sasami.  This is who I am now.

SASAMI
Has it really been that long?  Is Ayeka the reason you keep the disguise?

Grandfather changes into Yoshou.

GRANDFATHER
What would happen to Ayeka if she saw me now?

SASAMI
She has grown stronger than you think brother.  What is better, living
the truth or living the lie?

Yoshou shakes his head as he looks down at his hands.

SASAMI
You do resemble your brother.

YOSHOU
In more ways than one.

SASAMI
When did you decide not to marry Ayeka?

Yoshou looks up.

YOSHOU
Please Sasami not here and now.

SASAMI
I saw Little Washu before coming here.  I asked her to turn off all of
her monitoring devices.  She said she did and I trust her.

YOSHOU
You have Tsunami's memories.  You should know.

SASAMI
I have her memories, but that doesn't give me understanding.  Also her
memories may not reflect reality.

YOSHOU
I first met Tsunami when Ayeka was six.  I thought it was a dream.
A very enjoyable dream.  Father told me that I'd marry Ayeka on her
naming day.

SASAMI
What did Tsunami look like?

YOSHOU
She looked like Ayeka does now only with a kinder face.

SASAMI
So she pretended to be Ayeka.  Like she appeared as me at the spa.

YOSHOU
Yes that is true.  The second time I met her she revealed that she was
Tsunami.  From that point on I no longer wanted to marry Ayeka.  Ayeka
gave me nothing but love growing up.  I returned kindness but there was
no love in me for her.

SASAMI
It's lonely to live eternally.  You're not the first man she has chosen.
You weren't even the first one who could've been Emperor.

YOSHOU
The two of them were driving me crazy.  I even though of killing myself
to end it all.  Then Kagato and Ryoko came.  That gave me a chance to
escape with honor.

SASAMI
And so you came here to die.

YOSHOU
Yes.  I knew that Tsunami couldn't follow me.  I didn't think Ayeka
would be able to.

SASAMI
But your Funaho flourished here on Earth.

YOSHOU
No Life Tree ever survived outside of Jurai.  I couldn't understand why
Funaho did so well here.  She was not the first Life Tree to take root
on Earth.  None of the others survived more than a hundred years.  Later
I finally put Ryoko's gems and Funahos survival together.

SASAMI
It was 650 years before you married Itsuki.  What did you do during that
time?

YOSHOU
I was a hermit for the first couple of hundred years.  I'd move to a
place and grow old.  I would then disappear and move to a new place.

SASAMI
Then what?

YOSHOU
I saw how people treated each other.  I tried to help as best I could.
I'd align myself with one shogun, or another, that would best care for
the people.  I can see why my mother was happy to escape this planet.
For the last 250 years I have been a priest moving from one area to
another.

SASAMI
How many wives have you had?

Yoshou winces.

YOSHOU
Itsuki was my seventh wife.

SASAMI
How many children?

YOSHOU
Achika is my only child.

SASAMI
Why with seven wives?

YOSHOU
Our blood has drifted apart over time.  We are not as compatible as some
may think.  When Itsuki saw my Funaho she was taken by it.  Maybe Funaho
did something to her. She gave her life for Achika.  She was the last
woman to break through to my heart.

SASAMI
Until now.

Yoshou nods his head.

YOSHOU
I had hoped to live in obscurity for the remainder of my days.

SASAMI
Then came Tenchi.

YOSHOU
Yes.  I saw in him a power that surpassed my own.  As a baby he could
see Ryoko.

SASAMI
So Ryoko's stories about watching Tenchi grow up are true.  I take it
you could see her also.

Yoshou nods his head as his eyes mist over.

YOSHOU
Yes, I could see her.  After I locked her up I left the area.  It was
only sixty years ago that I returned.

SASAMI
A long time to be alone.

YOSHOU
Tenchi would play with her every chance he had.  He could see her until
the day before his mother died.  On that day he went to pour out his
heart to her but I could tell he no longer saw her.

SASAMI
What did you do?

YOSHOU
Nothing.  I reinforced the legend about the evil in the cave and told
him to stay away.

SASAMI
Did that work?

YOSHOU
Whenever Tenchi was troubled he did not come to his father or me.  He
went to the cave talked to someone he couldn't even see.  She would
listen to his every word.  One day Nobuyuki finally put his wife's death
behind him.  He and Tenchi moved to the city.  Before he left Tenchi
went to the cave to say good bye.

SASAMI
That must have been a hard scene.

YOSHOU
I felt so sorry for Ryoko I almost let her go.  Instead, after Tenchi
left, I told her that he would be back one day to set her free.

SASAMI
At least that came true.

YOSHOU
I never went to the cave again after that.  It would be ten more years
before Tenchi released her.

SASAMI
Ten years alone with only that for hope?

YOSHOU
Yes.  I believe that is when she let her body decay.  I asked Tenchi to
work here the summer he released her.

SASAMI
I understand now why Ryoko resented us when we arrived.

YOSHOU
She was not the only one to resent your arrival.

SASAMI
Tsunami still loves you Yoshou.  She'll love you until you leave this
mortal realm.  Then she'll mourn you until loneliness seizes her again.

YOSHOU
That's what I feared.

SASAMI
She's not a jealous woman.  She could never have given you a child.

YOSHOU
After her all others are nothing.

SASAMI
That may have been true for Ayeka.  Is it true for Washu?

YOSHOU
I don't want to betray Washu.  I can only keep running away.

SASAMI
It's time to stop running.  What would betray her more?  The truth, or
the lie?

Sasami stands and walks over to Yoshou.

She kisses him on the cheek.

SASAMI
I love you brother.  I'll speak no more of this.  Thank you for sharing
tea with me.

Sasami leaves the room.

Yoshou moves over to the shrine and returns to prayers.

INT. Family room – DAY

Washu sit watching television alone.

An old black and white film is on TV.

Sasami enters the room.

She sits next to Washu.

SASAMI
I'm finished.  You may want to wait a bit before turning the stuff back
on.

WASHU
He knew about the devices.

Sasami nods her head.

WASHU
I'll wait until Grandfather says I can turn them on.

Sasami nods her head again and hugs Washu.

Washu holds Sasami tightly while she cries on her shoulder.

FADE OUT:

END ACT TWO



ACT THREE

FADE IN:

INT. Kitchen – NIGHT

Tenchi is grilling fish.

A green salad sits on the island counter.

Chicken and vegetables are near the sink.

Ayeka walks in.

AYEKA
Can I help you Tenchi?

TENCHI
Yes, please.  I still need to make simmered chicken and vegetables.
Could you cut the vegetables into pretty shapes?

AYEKA
Yes I can do that.

Ayeka starts to work on the vegetables.

Ryoko walks in.

RYOKO
Hi guys.  Can I help?

Ayeka sniffs.

TENCHI
Yes please.  Can you cut the chicken into half-inch cubes?

RYOKO
Okay.

Ryoko moves next to Ayeka and starts cutting the chicken.

INT. Dining room – NIGHT

Grandfather sits at the end nearest the kitchen, and Kazuhiko sits at
the opposite end.  To Grandfather's right sit Ayeka, Tenchi, Ryoko, and
Mihoshi.  To his left sit Washu, Ryo-Ohki in her girl form, Sasami,
Daijiro, and Ryoe.

KAZUHIKO
This is very good Tenchi.

TENCHI
Ayeka and Ryoko helped.

RYOE
Well I am still breathing so things must be getting better around here.

Everyone laughs over that comment.

MIHOSHI
We'll be home tomorrow.

DAIJIRO
It has been a long time.

WASHU
Almost a year has past since we left Earth.

GRANDFATHER
I hope Nobuyuki has kept things up at the temple.

TENCHI
I'm sure dad has things running smoothly.  I'll be happy to return.

RYOE
Just make sure you call us before you leave the planet again.

TENCHI
Wouldn't you like to return to a normal life?

Daijiro hugs Ryoe.

DAIJIRO
Normal is boring.  Even with all that has happened to me I wouldn't have
missed this.

Ryoe nods her head.

KAZUHIKO
I still have to finish my training.  Mihoshi may be able to get me into
the academy.

AYEKA
I didn't know they allowed applicants from protected planets.

MIHOSHI
They don't, but I happen to know the Grand Marshall personally.

The group shares another laugh.

WASHU
What do you have planned Tenchi?

TENCHI
Ayeka's child is my whole concern now.

SASAMI
Well then I think I'll enjoy my last night on the ship.

Sasami takes Ryo-Ohki's hand and stands.

Ryo-Ohki stands with her.

RYO-OHKI
Miya?

Sasami walks around the table and stands next to Tenchi looking at him.

Ryo-Ohki reaches out to Tenchi.

Tenchi looks at the two of them.

He takes Ryo-Ohki's hand and stands.

RYO-OHKI
Miya!

The three leave the room.

Ryoko has a big grin on her face.

AYEKA
What are you so happy about?

RYOKO
Ryo-Ohki is happy.

AYEKA
She's your pet or starship or whatever.

Ryoko, keeping her big grin, looks at Ayeka.

RYOKO
No, she's Sasami's friend, and she worships Tenchi.  Now she has them
both together, alone, to herself.

WASHU
I would appreciate it if you didn't call my daughter a pet.

Everyone is looking at Ayeka.

Ayeka hides her face in her hands.

RYOKO
Leave my sister wife alone mom.  It's not like you never made any
mistakes.

Ryoko takes Ayeka's hand and stands pulling Ayeka to her feet.

AYEKA
Why do you protect me Ryoko?

RYOKO
Because, Ayeka, no matter what they may say everyone on this ship loves
you.

Ayeka begins crying.

Ryoko hugs her and walks her from the room.

Washu takes Grandfather's hand.

They look at each other and stand.

Washu and Grandfather leave the room.

Daijiro stands picking Ryoe up with him.

They leave the room.

KAZUHIKO
So much for if you cook you clean.

Mihoshi starts gathering dishes.

MIHOSHI
Does it really matter?

Kazuhiko gathers dishes.

KAZUHIKO
No, not really.

MIHOSHI
We'll have the TV to ourselves tonight.  I can finally watch the new
episodes of Galaxy Police Policeman.

Kazuhiko smiles.

INT. Yukinojo's bridge – DAY (Tuesday, 19 May 1998; 17th Day, 3rd Month)

Mihoshi and Kazuhiko sit in the command chairs.

Mihoshi has a comic book in her hands and is reading.

MIHOSHI
Let's see what you have learned.  Go ahead and land in the lake by the
house.

KAZUHIKO
Okay.  Let's see step one is to acquire the planet's beacon.

Kazuhiko plays with the controls.

KAZUHIKO
Ah…  Yukinojo I can't find the beacon.

YUKINOJO
Earth does not have a beacon.

KAZUHIKO
Mihoshi!  What do I do now?

Mihoshi looks up from her book and smiles at him.

MIHOSHI
Were you listening during training or were you just looking at me?

KAZUHIKO
Well I was…  Ah…  Well both.

MIHOSHI
If you don't do something you're going to break my ship.  I don't know
if Ms. Washu has enough repair parts.

KAZUHIKO
If there is no beacon then you must do a manual landing.

Mihoshi returns to her comic.

KAZUHIKO
Yukinojo prep for manual landing.  Please display a glide path to the
lake.

YUKINOJO
Yes Kazuhiko.  It is on the screen to the left.

KAZUHIKO
Thank you.

Mihoshi pushes a button on her console.

MIHOSHI
We'll be landing in about ten minutes.

Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko, and Washu walk onto the bridge.

They remain standing behind the command chairs.

The lake, with a house next to it, comes up on the view screen.

MIHOSHI
It looks like someone has moved in while we were gone.

TENCHI
All the land belongs to the temple.

RYOKO
I'd say by the looks of that house it was designed by Father.

AYEKA
You are right Ryoko.  I think it's your house Tenchi.

TENCHI
What?  You must be joking.

KAZUHIKO
Your dad is an architect.

MIHOSHI
And we haven't been spending his money for the last year.

Tenchi shakes his head.

RYOKO
He's Achika's husband.

AYEKA
I think it's a wedding present for you Tenchi.

MIHOSHI
That'is so sweet.

EXT. Lake – DAY

Yukinojo gently lands on the lake's surface.

GRANDFATHER
Yes it's Nobuyuki.

TENCHI
Let's go see what he wants.

The group moves around the lake.

EXT. New house – DAY

Father stands on the porch.

The rest move into the scene.

FATHER
Well Tenchi, do you like your new house?

TENCHI
How could you afford this Father?

FATHER
Is that anyway to show your gratitude?

Tenchi bows low.

TENCHI
I'm sorry Father.  I'm overwhelmed by this surprise.

RYOKO
I think this is totally cool.  Can we look around?

Father opens the sliding door.

FATHER
Please come inside and I'll give you a grand tour.

Follow the group around the house.

The family room has two low tables.  Four couches.  A large flat screen
television.

There are four bedrooms on this level also.  Each one has its own
bathroom.  There's one is for you Tenchi and the other three are for
Ayeka, Ryoko, and your third wife.

SASAMI
Are they furnished yet?

The group enters a bedroom.

FATHER
I only got the furniture.  I wanted to leave the decorating to the owner.

There is an American style king size bed, and a table with four chairs.
There is also a desk with computer.  Plus a dresser vanity, and a large
walk in closet.  There is a door to the bathroom.

AYEKA
This place is beautiful Father.  You've put so much effort into it.

TENCHI
Your house is going to seem empty when we move into here.

FATHER
Well it can be used for overflow if you get to many guests.  You never
know when the Emperor and his family might drop in.

Father hands Tenchi and envelope.

FATHER
This will help you get started on decorating the house with linens and
curtains.

Tenchi hugs his father.

TENCHI
I can't thank you enough Father.

FATHER
Those grandchildren will be thanks enough for me Tenchi.  How are you
doing Ayeka?

Ayeka places her hand on her stomach.

AYEKA
I'm doing very well Father, thank you.

FATHER
And you Ryoko?

Ryoko chuckles.

RYOKO
You'll have to wait a little longer before you have a granddaughter from
me Father.

Father sighs.

Tenchi rolls his eyes.

TENCHI
You haven't changed at all, dad.

FATHER
There've been some small changes.  I now own the architecture firm.
I designed two urban renewal projects for the United States. My old boss
retired and he let me buy out his options.

Everyone stares at Father.

GRANDFATHER
You have done the family proud son.

FATHER
Thank you dad.  I owe it all to Achika.

SASAMI
You will stay for supper tonight?

FATHER
Of course Sasami.

RYOE
Well in the mean time let's go shopping.  We need to pretty this place
up with a woman's touch.  Come on girls; let's make our list.

All the women start discussing colors.

The men move out of the bedroom.

INT. Family room – DAY

The men enter the room.

You gentlemen wait here.

KAZUHIKO
To peace.

EVERYONE
To peace.

FATHER
Welcome home son.

TENCHI
Thank you Father.

FATHER
It's a good thing Ryoko let me know when you were coming home.  I am
supposed to be in New York right now.

GRANDFATHER
You go to the United States?

Father nods his head.

TENCHI
Wow!  That must be fun.

FATHER
About twenty five percent of my firm's business is in the United States.
I'm traveling as much as I'm here.  I thought moving up would give me
more time off.

GRANDFATHER
I 'm very proud of your accomplishment son.

FATHER
Thank you father.  I would not have been able to do it without Achika's
help.  She still inspires me today.

TENCHI
It has been a long time.  I think I will visit with mother now.

Tenchi stands.

Grandfather and Father also stand.

The three leave the room.

KAZUHIKO
Tenchi lost his mother when he was five.

Daijiro nods his head.

DAIJIRO
You've known him a lot longer than me.

KAZUHIKO
Yes we went to the same elementary school and stayed together ever since.

INT. Family room – DAY

Kazuhiko and Daijiro sit watching television.

They are eating noodles.

Ryoko, Ayeka, Mihoshi, Ryoe, Sasami, and Ryo-Ohki come in.

RYOKO
Hi guys.  Where's Tenchi?

KAZUHIKO
He's up at his mother's grave.  Grandfather and Father are with him.

DAIJIRO
They've been up there for about two hours now.

Ryoko looks at Ayeka and Sasami.

Both nod their head.

The three leave the room.

Mihoshi and Ryoe join them on the couch.

KAZUHIKO
Where's Little Washu?

MIHOSHI
She wanted to get something for diner tonight.  She said she would use
her portal to get back.

DAIJIRO
Where's all the shopping?

RYOE
It's in the van.  We were looking for some strong men to move it inside.

Both Kazuhiko and Daijiro chuckle.

They stand and leave the room.

Ryoe and Mihoshi stand and follow them.

EXT. Gravesite near the shrine – DAY

Grandfather, Father, and Tenchi sit by the graves of Achika and Itsuki.

They are drinking sake.

There are a couple of empty bottles on the ground and two full ones.

Ryoko, Ayeka, and Sasami enter the scene.

Sasami holds her nose while Ryoko and Ayeka cross their arms.

The men stare at them bleary eyed.

The three girls sit down with the men.

RYOKO
Well are you going to pour for us?  We would like to honor Achika and
Itsuki too.

Father pours for all three girls and refills the men's cups.

RYOKO
As you see Achika, your son has fulfilled your dreams.  Thank you.
Kampai!

EVERYONE
Kampai!

They all drink down their sake.

Sasami shudders.

RYOKO
I think I'll visit the cave now.

Ryoko stands up and walks off to the shrine entrance.

Tenchi quickly follows her.

Ayeka touches Sasami and they both stand and follow Tenchi and Ryoko.

FATHER
He has truly grown into a man during this journey.

GRANDFATHER
Much has happened Nobuyuki.  Let's go to the temple and I'll catch you
up on events.

Both men depart the scene.

INT. Family room – DAY (Saturday, 23 May 1998; 21st Day, 3rd Month)

Mihoshi is sleeping on the couch.

The television is on.

Mihoshi's bracelet starts beeping.

Sasami enters the room.

She walks over to Mihoshi and starts shaking her.

MIHOSHI
Just a few more minutes Kiyone.

SASAMI
Wake up Mihoshi.  Your bracelet is beeping.

Mihoshi opens her eyes.

MIHOSHI
Oh my!

Mihoshi looks at her bracelet.

MIHOSHI
It's an emergency!

She touches her bracelet and disappears.

Tenchi walks into the room.

TENCHI
I thought I heard Mihoshi's bracelet going off.

SASAMI
It was.  She just left on an emergency call, and I just got lunch ready
too.

TENCHI
It'll be okay.  She will be back in a day or two.  Grandfather has me
training again this afternoon.

Mihoshi comes running into the room.

She is dripping wet.

MIHOSHI
Tenchi!

She runs up to Tenchi and hugs him.

Tenchi is soaked immediately.

TENCHI
Mihoshi, you need to figure out how to get on your ship without getting
wet.

MIHOSHI
I got on okay.  I got wet when I ran out the door to see you.

TENCHI
What's wrong?

MIHOSHI
I got a message from Kiyone.  She's in trouble and needs me.

TENCHI
Where is she?

Ayeka, Ryoko, Ryo-Ohki, and Kazuhiko come in for lunch.

MIHOSHI
She is in the SAR system.  It's a star you call Sirius.

TENCHI
Is that far away?

MIHOSHI
Yes, and I'll be gone for at least three months.  I'm supposed to
protect Sasami and I don't know what to do!

TENCHI
I'll be here to protect Sasami.  Kiyone is your friend and we must help
our friends when they need us.

AYEKA
What's going on?  Why are you both so wet?

Mihoshi starts crying.

RYOKO
Why is Mihoshi hugging you Tenchi?

TENCHI
Kiyone is in trouble and we're trying to decide how best to help her.

KAZUHIKO
We have to go and rescue her!

Ayeka looks down and holds her stomach.

TENCHI
I am staying here with Ayeka.

SASAMI
Someone has to go.  Kiyone is our friend too.

Tenchi nods his head.

TENCHI
Mihoshi you will have to go.  We will stay here on Earth and everything
will be all right.

KAZUHIKO
I'll go with you Mihoshi.

MIHOSHI
It will be dangerous.  I don't want anyone to be hurt.

KAZUHIKO
Why will you go?

MIHOSHI
She is my friend and I love her.  Plus I am a Galaxy Policewoman and
it's my job.

KAZUHIKO
She's my friend also and haven't you been training me to be a Galaxy
Policeman?

Mihoshi nods her head.

KAZUHIKO
Then it's our duty to go.

TENCHI
Yes Mihoshi.  It's your duty to go, and it would be good to have someone
to help you.

RYOKO
Kiyone is our friend too.  I know you will do a good job Mihoshi.

Mihoshi lets go of Tenchi and hugs Ryoko getting her wet.

MIHOSHI
You're so sweet Ryoko.  Thank you.

Mihoshi hugs Ayeka and Sasami getting them wet.

MIHOSHI
Are you sure you want to go Kazuhiko?

Kazuhiko nods his head.

Mihoshi touches her bracelet and they both disappear.

SASAMI
I hope they both will be all right.

RYOKO
Mihoshi will come through in the end.  Whatever trouble Kiyone is in
she'll take care of it.

Ayeka starts to laugh.

AYEKA
Let's hope the universe can afford to pay for Mihoshi's help.

The rest join in the laughter.

RYOKO
Is lunch ready yet?  I'm hungry.

SASAMI
Yes, I just finished it.

The group moves into the dining room.

INT. Yukinojo's bridge – DAY

Mihoshi and Kazuhiko sit in the command chairs.

A field of moving stars is on the view screen.

MIHOSHI
Yukinojo, I'll need two staterooms please, and get me that speech they
use to swear in new detectives.

Yukinojo drops out of the ceiling.

YUKINOJO
The changes are being done.  I downloaded the info to your pen.

MIHOSHI
Thank you Yukinojo.

Mihoshi takes out her pen and opens it up.

MIHOSHI
Are you sure you want to be a Galaxy Policeman?

KAZUHIKO
Yes, this is the thing I have been waiting for all my life.

MIHOSHI
Then repeat after me.

INT. Dining room – DAY

Washu enters just before lunch is finished.

WASHU
Anything left for me.

SASAMI
Of course Little Washu.  I'll get it for you.

WASHU
No that's all right Sasami.  I can help myself.

Washu exits for the kitchen.

She returns with food.

She sits down at the table.

WASHU
Where's Mihoshi?

TENCHI
She and Kazuhiko have left on a rescue mission to help Kiyone.

Washu looks stunned.

WASHU
She's left!  Where did she go?

TENCHI
She went to the SAR system.

WASHU
That's on the far end of nowhere!  This has to be bad.

AYEKA
What is wrong Ms. Washu?

WASHU
I gave a lot to keep Mihoshi around.  Now you've let her go.

SASAMI
What else could we do?  Kiyone is our friend and she needs help.

RYOKO
Lighten up mom.  She'll only be gone for a few months.

WASHU
What if it's the Ladies doing?

Everyone's eyes go wide.

TENCHI
Do you really think so?

Washu shrugs her shoulders.

WASHU
I hope not but this is too strange.  Just think what it would take for
Kiyone to ask for Mihoshi's help.

AYEKA
She must be near death or insane.

WASHU
Or even worse.

TENCHI
What do we do now?

WASHU
We need to prepare for the worst.

Everyone nods their head.

INT. Yukinojo's bridge – DAY

Mihoshi and Kazuhiko sit in the command chairs.

MIHOSHI
Yukinojo register Kazuhiko with the rank of Detective Basic.

YUKINOJO
Mihoshi, people from protected planets cannot join the Galaxy Police.

MIHOSHI
Well it's to late for that now.  Send a letter to my grandfather
explaining the situation and he'll understand.

YUKINOJO
Yes, Mihoshi.

MIHOSHI
Set course for cross galaxy travel to the SAR system.

YUKINOJO
Course set.

MIHOSHI
Let's go!

KAZUHIKO
So what do I do now?

MIHOSHI
Your first mission is to make lunch.  I'm hungry.

Kazuhiko laughs as he leaves the bridge.

INT. Tenchi's bedroom – NIGHT (Sunday, 24 May 1998; 22nd Day, 3rd Month)

Tenchi enters the room.

He takes off his shirt.

The bathroom door opens and Sasami walks out naked.

TENCHI
Sasami!

Sasami walks toward Tenchi.

SASAMI
Hello Tenchi.

TENCHI
God you are beautiful.  It's Sunday.  What brings you here?

Sasami walks up to Tenchi and lays a hand on his chest.

SASAMI
Do I need a reason?

Tenchi kisses her.

TENCHI
Of course not.

SASAMI
Take me Tenchi.

TENCHI
What!?  Sa…  Sasami we aren't married yet!

SASAMI
I don't care anymore!  We'll be married soon and I can't wait!

TENCHI
Stop it!  This is wrong.  We talked about this before.

SASAMI
I'm done talking.

Sasami trips Tenchi to the floor.

Tenchi is laying on his back with Sasami on top of him.

TENCHI
Stop this!  Help!  Ayeka, Ryoko!

There is a pounding on the door.

SASAMI
It's to late for them now.

The door bursts into splinters as it flies into the room.

Ryoko, naked, and Ayeka and Sasami, in their pajamas, stand in the
doorway.

Their eyes go wide as they look into the room.

SASAMI
Tsunami, what are you doing?

Rage crosses Tsunami/Sasami's face.

She disappears.

Tenchi stands up and walks to the door.

He takes Sasami's hand and pulls her into the room.

He kisses Ryoko and Ayeka.

TENCHI
Good night.  Thank you for helping me.

AYEKA
But Tenchi what was she doing?

TENCHI
Later please.  Good night.

AYEKA
But Tenchi…

RYOKO (overlapping)
Let's go Princess.  We can talk about it in the morning.

Ryoko pulls Ayeka away from the door.

AYEKA (O. C.)
I want to know what's going on!

RYOKO (O. C.)
I don't know either, and we aren't going to find out now.  So let's go
to bed.

The sound of a door closing.

Tenchi looks around his room and leaves still holding Sasami's hand.

INT. Sasami's room – NIGHT

Tenchi and Sasami enter the room.

Tenchi moves over to Sasami's desk and lets go of her hand.

He sits at the desk.

TENCHI
What did just happen back there?

SASAMI
You have to understand Tsunami.  I know what she did and why she did it,
but I can't explain it now.

TENCHI
Can't you do better than that?

SASAMI
I have so many secrets Tenchi.  Some are happy and joyous and others are
dark and evil.  Tsunami is so lonely Tenchi, and so am I.

TENCHI
You don't have to be lonely Sasami.  You can always come to me.

SASAMI
Two nights a week is not enough.

TENCHI
That does not stop Ayeka.

SASAMI
I'm not my sister.

TENCHI
Oh, really.  She is lonely too.  If she is not with me she is with Ryoko
or you.  She'll even stay with Mihoshi and Washu to keep from being
alone.  You're always welcome with any of us Sasami.  We are your family.

SASAMI
Thank you Tenchi.

TENCHI
Sasami?

Sasami looks up at Tenchi.

TENCHI
When I saw you earlier or at least what I thought was you.  You were so
beautiful.  I suddenly thought that I loved you…

SASAMI (overlapping)
Stop it right there!

Sasami hits Tenchi on top of the head.

SASAMI
Never say it and never think it.  Stop using that brain of yours.

She punches him in the chest.

SASAMI
And start using your heart.  If you ever love one of us more than the
others, it all ends Tenchi.

TENCHI
Thank you for the advice Sasami.  What I was trying to say is that
I love you enough to marry you now.  I realized your appearance and
age does not matter anymore.

Sasami sits down on the floor.

SASAMI
Oh.  I am sorry I yelled at you.  I wasn't sure what Tsunami might have
done to you.

TENCHI
That's okay.  I still love you each differently.  Now I truly love each
of you equally.

SASAMI
You've said that before.  What does it mean?

TENCHI
I love Ryoko for her spirit.  It's so free.  I love Ayeka for her will.
She's so strong.  I love you for your soul.  It's so pure and beautiful.

Sasami chuckles.

TENCHI
What is so funny?

SASAMI
If you were to ask us why we love you.  I love you for your soul.
I loved you from the moment I saw you in the ship's jail.  Your soul
shines with a pure, bright light.  Ryoko loves you for your free spirit.
It is something she can only dream of having.  Ayeka loves you for your
will, your courage to stand up for what is right even when you can't
win.  She is full of self-doubt.

Tenchi kneels down beside Sasami.

TENCHI
That must be why we work so well together.  Can I stay here tonight?
My room is a bit of a mess.

Sasami nods her head.

Tenchi strips down to his boxers.

Both get into bed.

TENCHI
What will we do about Tsunami?

SASAMI
Let me talk to her.  I think I can straighten this all out.

TENCHI
Okay Sasami.  I forgive her, and I'll let you handle it.  Good night.

SASAMI
Good night Tenchi.

INT. Yukinojo's bridge – NIGHT (Monday, 1 June 1998; First Day, 4th
Month)

Mihoshi and Kazuhiko sit in the command chairs.

Mihoshi is reading a book while Kazuhiko works at his console.

KAZUHIKO
Where are we going?

MIHOSHI
We're going to the SAR system.

KAZUHIKO
I've been working on the navigation program.  We're moving perpendicular
to the galactic plane, not to the SAR system.

MIHOSHI
It is safer to fly above the star systems.

KAZUHIKO
I thought that might be it.  I ran a collision program and got one point
two times ten to the negative six

Mihoshi stands up and moves to the back of the bridge.

MIHOSHI
Please join me over here.

Kazuhiko joins her.

MIHOSHI
Yukinojo, rig for ultra speed.

YUKINOJO
Yes Mihoshi.

The command chairs seem to melt and reform into something looking like
a cocoon.

KAZUHIKO
What's ultra speed?

Mihoshi sits in her new chair.

Kazuhiko sits next to her.

KAZUHIKO
This is comfortable.

Mihoshi pulls out a glass cylinder that has a golden glow.

KAZUHIKO
What's that?

MIHOSHI
It's ultra energy.

KAZUHIKO
And what's that?

MIHOSHI
It's a whole bunch of energy.

KAZUHIKO
How much is in there?

Mihoshi looks at the cylinder.

MIHOSHI
About a stars worth.

Kazuhiko's eyes go wide.

KAZUHIKO
Wow!

A tube rises up next to Mihoshi.

YUKINOJO
Ship is ready for ultra speed.

MIHOSHI
Thank you Yukinojo.

KAZUHIKO
How fast is ultra speed.

MIHOSHI
Oh, about thirty four and a half billion miles a second.

Kazuhiko looks stunned.

YUKINOJO
Collision probability is now less than point one times ten to the
negative ten.

Mihoshi drops the ultra energy into the tube.

MIHOSHI
Lean back in your chair Kazuhiko.  Let's go Yukinojo.

Both Mihoshi and Kazuhiko are pushed back into their chairs.

EXT. Space – NIGHT

Yukinojo fills the scene viewed from the rear.

The engines flare a bright white.

The ship is gone.

FADE OUT:

THE END
