It was a quite yet peace day at the Masaki residence. For the 
first time in history Ryoko and Ayeka weren't fighting. Ryoko stood 
outside on the porch drinking saki. A few days ago Tenchi said that he 
was close to choosing the girl for him. Ayeka went in melt down and, 
Ryoko just sighed. She had something else on her mind. For the past few 
nights she had been have flashbacks of her past. They were unique 
because she never had seen these things.
What worried her most was that she seemed to be on Juari. Ryoko 
didn't want to do what was in her mind but she did it anyway. As she 
got closer to the lab door she heard someone clear there throat. Ryoko 
slowly turned around to see the man in her dreams. The long black hair 
and the maroon eye color. She knew this young man all to well. It was 
Yosho.
But at that moment Ayeka chose to come out of her room and see 
her half brother standing there young and handsome. "Yo-Yo, Yosho." she 
said, her voice faint, and as tried to come down the stairs she had 
teary eyes. "I'm sorry Ayeka but I need to talk to Ryoko alone." His 
voice simple and content. Ayeka glared at Ryoko for a second then sat 
down on the floor. He smiled and left out the door, Ryoko just fallowed 
slowly as clueless as possible.
 The clouds waved around in circles trying to do a dance. As 
Ryoko looked around to see that Yosho led her to the cave she began to 
get curious. He just stood there in front of her looking at her face. 
She looked up to see his face. "Hold on my love, we can go to the 
carnival together." He said as he held one of her hands to his lips and 
kissed it passionately. Ryoko lightly blushed. He held her other hand 
and led her to the cave entrance. Ryoko pulled back but he looked her 
in the eye and gave her some reassurance. She slowly entered to find 
that she wasn't in the cave she was on Juari.

In Washu's lab she was having a surge of energy come through one 
of computer readings. She checked the computer layout over her secret 
hidden camera's that were all over the place she got a huge energy 
reading from the cave. There seemed to be a time laps between the 
entrance and outside. "Oh god, where did this come from." She said as 
she checked all of the surroundings to see if anyone was missing. 
Tenchi, Sasami, Mihoshi, Kiyoni, Ayeka, and me they are here, where are 
Ryoko and Lord Katsuhito. Those two could be anywhere in the future or 
past. "Washu there safe for now." She heard someone say. She turned to 
Tsunami sitting there. "Where are they Tsunami?" Washu asked. "Ask 
Funaho my dear sister. She knows everything right now. They left for 
the past. Let them be for a while before you go off looking for them." 
Tsunami said as she waved good-bye to Washu phasing out of site. 
**********************************************************************
Ryoko opened her eyes to Yosho looking at her. "Have you woken up 
yet?" He asked. Ryoko just nodded. He lifted her up from the futon. 
"Come on Ryoko we need to get   you some food." He said as they left 
the room. They walked down the hallway of what seemed to be the Juari 
palace. Then a little crying of a baby could be heard. Ryoko looked at 
him. "I'll go get her." She said as she turned and went back down the 
hall. When she came back she held a little baby girl with dark purple 
hair. "Oh, there is my little girl." Yosho called as he looked at her. 
"Dada luv Miko." The little baby giggled. Ryoko looked at the little 
girl. "Yes dada loves you, so does mama." Ryoko answered. Yosho looked 
Ryoko in the eye for a while. "I don't feel like leaving the palace." 
He commented. 
She knew what that meant. As she set the baby in her lap on the 
stairs Yosho walked away. Soon he came back with a baby bottle in his 
hand. After a few refusals from Miko the baby finally drank the milk. 
Her curious eyes looking at anything that moved our looked like it 
moved. As footsteps were heard coming down the hall the couple turned 
to see Masaki. Her cheerfulness bright and working. "Oh, how is my 
little granddaughter doing?" Masaki asked as she gave Yosho a bone-
crushing hug. Ryoko looked up at the empress and smiled. "Beautifully 
mother, just beautifully."


Authors notes: Sorry for the particle cliffhanger. I couldn't think of 
anything else to write so I stopped. Next chapter: What's going on 
between Yosho and Ryoko? What is Tsunami up to? And where did Tenchi 
go? All that next. So long for now, Ja Ne!
