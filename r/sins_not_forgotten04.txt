                          "Sins not Forgotten"

                            - Chapter Four -
                               "Memories"



Katsuhito stepped into the lab, as he waited for the door behind him to close he took note 
of his surroundings. Washu's lab always seemed different every time he entered it; it was 
as if the lab could change itself to reflect the needs and or mood of its owner. Perhaps it 
could he mused silently to himself. For now it seemed to appear as a single hallway with 
pale green walls a white ceiling and a tiled marble floor.
Two doors stood opposite each other at the end of the hallway, as he approached he noticed 
a sign above each the one over the left read PATIENT and the one over the right read 
LABORATORY. Katsuhito entered the door on the left, inside the walls floor and ceiling 
matched that of the hallway, the room was spacious but not overly big a single bed dominated
the center of the room and was surrounded by a plethora of machines. Two chairs and a small 
table had been placed near the bed and a small enclosed bathroom occupied a corner. 
Arkain lay motionless on the bed; an oxygen mask was over his mouth and nose. His eyes 
closed, probably sleeping under a sedative Washu had given him, and his hair was burned and 
had become a charred gray color. His chest and right arm were bandaged, the arm more so as 
it had taken the apparent brunt of Ryoko's fury. Ryoko's actions had been instinctive and 
based in fear he thought to himself. He had since decided not to scold her about it. Her 
break down after Tenchi had told her the truth of Arkain's identity, and the pain he saw in 
her eyes over seven centuries ago, convinced him that at heart Ryoko was not a malevolent 
person, mischief however that was another story. What concerned him now was the reaction 
Arkain would have once presented with the truth.

Katsuhito looked over his shoulder as the door behind him opened. 
"Morning Grandpa." Tenchi said has he closed the door behind him. "How's he doing." 

"He is expected to recover fully." his grandfather replied, "The question is what do we tell
him when he does." 

"Well..." Tenchi began "We could just tell him the van exploded." Katsuhito gave Tenchi a 
wry look 

"I suppose so, exploding vehicles are quite common these days, or so I've heard." 
Katsuhito said with a note of sarcasm.

"I see your point." Tenchi acknowledged "But how do we explain to him that Ryoko blasted 
him because she thought he was Kagato." 

"Well..." groaned Arkain as his left eye opened. "You can start... ughn... by telling me 
who... Ryoko is... and why she hates this Kagato guy bad enough to want to kill me in his 
place." 

Tenchi and Katsuhito both startled, as they regained themselves Katsuhito moved over to a 
chair and sat down.

"I... I thought you said he was asleep." Tenchi stammered as he took the seat next to his 
grandfather 

"I dozed off after the doctor left, I woke back up when your grandfather came in." Arkain 
reached out with his left hand toward Katsuhito. "It's a pleasure to meet you sir." He said 
as Katsuhito shook his hand. 

"Tell me." Katsuhito asked, "What do you remember about last night." 

"Well..." Arkain coughed lightly as he cleared his throat and clutched his chest. "Damn that
hurts... " Arkain winced in pain "As I was trying to say." he began again "I had gotten my 
stuff out of the back of the van... speaking of which where is my stuff." 

"Uuhm... Well." Tenchi said, "You might be happy to know that your sword made it through ok 
but..." 

"But what." Arkain asked. 

"Well your bag and the other stuff you had in it... well it didn't fare to well." 

Arkain slapped his hand over his face "Geez that really sucks my clothes and all my money 
were in that bag." 

Katsuhito cleared his throat to gain attention "Do not worry we will help you as best we 
can." He said "Once you are well enough to be about you may stay with me at the shrine or 
if you wish you may stay at the house with Tenchi." Katsuhito offered, "But for now please 
continue with your story." 

"Ok now where was I... Oh yeah." Arkain said as he resumed his story "I had just gotten my 
stuff out, when I saw a flash of orange light about then boom next thing I know I'm back up 
against a tree and my whole body hurts. The last thing I remember seeing is an angel with 
blue hair floating over the van. I thought I was dead and she had come to claim my soul. 
Next thing I remember is waking up here." 

"Well I'm sure that's the first time anyone in this house has called Ryoko an angel." Washu 
said as she entered the room. Katsuhito and Tenchi both turned to see an adult Washu, 
Katsuhito noticed Arkain blush slightly as Washu walked to the foot of his bed. "And how is 
the patient feeling now." Washu asked with a yawn. 

"Like death warmed over, and everything hurts like hell." Arkain answered 

"Well this will fix you right up." Washu said with a grin as she pulled an IV bag from her 
coat pocket. She hung the bag on a stand near the head of the bed. She then inserted a 
needle into the back of his left hand. 

"Uungh that tickled." Arkain groaned as Washu began tuning the monitor that was part of the 
stand. As she finished adjusting the machine Washu took a hypodermic and injected a silvery 
liquid into the solution inside the bag. After a few seconds the entire contents of the bag 
consisted of the silver liquid. "Nice trick... mind telling me what's in that..." Arkain 
began to ask as he trailed off into a deep sleep. 

"Oh just a sedative, and a small colony of nanites I developed." Washu grinned to her 
sleeping patient.

"Aren't those things dangerous?" Tenchi questioned Washu. 

"He'll be fine." the red haired scientist replied "They will pass out of his system 
harmlessly in a few days. But until they do, their job is to help him heal. And that 
sedative they're contained in will last about twelve hours so you might have to wait awhile 
to explain anything to him." 

"I see." Katsuhito said with an understanding nod.

"What did you plan on telling him Grandpa?" Tenchi asked. 

"We will tell him the truth." Katsuhito said firmly. 

"I hope he can take it." Tenchi said with a slight grin. 

"We'll just have to wait and see." Washu said as she drew a small sample of blood from 
Arkain's left arm and also carefully removed a single hair from his charred locks. 
"If he can survive a blast from Ryoko he can survive with the truth about us."
Washu replied. 

"You mean if he can survive under the care of a mad genius doctor don't you." Katsuhito 
chuckled 

"Hmmph." Washu grunted as she directed an icy glare toward the elder Masaki "If you boys 
will excuse me." Washu said with a hint of authority in her voice. "The greatest scientific 
genius in the universe has some tests to run and sleep to catch up on." 

"Hint taken." Tenchi said as he got up and tugged at his grandfather's sleeve "Come on 
Grandpa let's see if we can find something for breakfast." Katsuhito stood up and all three 
left the room, Washu headed to the interior of the lab while Tenchi and Katsuhito headed 
out to the kitchen.

"Waaah! I can't find it." came Mihoshi's ear piercing wail from the kitchen. 

Tenchi moved quickly toward the kitchen as Katsuhito followed. Mihoshi sat on one side of 
the table, flanked on one side by her partner Kiyone and on the other by a very tall pile 
of police equipment, discarded food wrappers, and other random items. Across the table sat 
Ayeka and Noboyuki. Everyone but Mihoshi had hands clamped tightly over their ears, Mihoshi 
however was busy with both hands reaching into a small leather handbag and removing various 
items from within it's confines. 

"What's wrong?" Tenchi questioned the group. 

"Nothing really." Kiyone began 

"Mihoshi lost her new friends communicator access code or phone number if you will." Ayeka 
finished.

"So where did all this other stuff come from." Tenchi asked pointing at the pile of debris 
and refuse forming next to a frantic Mihoshi 

"Remember Washu's Christmas present to Mihoshi." Kiyone explained. 

"Yeah, I remember" Tenchi replied, "It was a new purse." 

"Exactly." Kiyone stated "But it's a purse that contains a pocket of subspace inside it." 

"Washu said the purse would be easier for her to manage." Ayeka continued. 
"Instead of her having to rely on her control cube all the time Mihoshi could put things 
inside the purse for easier and safer retrieval." 

"That's it." Mihoshi exclaimed, "I'll go ask Washu she'll know what to do." Mihoshi quickly 
closed her purse and raced toward the lab.

Nobuyuki got up next and headed toward the front door of the living room "Well I'm heading 
back to my apartment." he said as he grabbed his coat 

"Are you sure Dad." Tenchi asked "That storm could hit any minute, aren't you worried you'll
get caught in it and what about the van." 

"I'll be fine." Nobuyuki assured his son "And don't worry about the van, your grandpa had 
Washu fix it or rather replace it last night. Heh if I do say so the new one is better than 
the old one. I'll make it home before the storm hits." 

"Ok then see you next weekend." Tenchi said sheepishly. Nobuyuki waved and walked out the 
door. Katsuhito placed a hand on Tenchi's shoulder 

"He'll be fine." he assured his grandson "I'll be at the shrine until supper call on me if 
you need anything before then." he said. Tenchi only nodded as his grandfather walked toward
the rear of the kitchen toward the door. After he had left Tenchi sat down at the table 
with Ayeka and Kiyone, as he sat there he found himself staring out the window at ever 
darkening clouds that drifted through the sky thunder sounded far off as it announced the 
fury of the approaching storm.

Washu sat quietly in her lab as she ponder over the newest data produced by her latest 
readings from Arkain's hair and blood sample

'This is odd she thought, no normal person would have an astral pattern with reading this 
far off the norm. His psyche pattern is also abnormal. His alpha and over dimension patterns 
are normal but...' Her thoughts were cut off as she heard footsteps approach her from behind. 
"Yes Mihoshi, what is it?" she asked politely. Mihoshi stopped dead 

"How did you know it was me." she asked with a slight giggle.

"Because." Washu calmly explained "Your the only person I know who can get in here unnoticed 
and undetected. Now what do you want, I'm busy."

"Well it's about my new purse." Mihoshi explained "Is there anyway to get everything out of 
it all at once." she asked. 

"It's simple really." Washu explained to her not even bothering to turn around "Hold it 
upside down, tap the clasp twice, then open it. Everything inside will come out." 

"Like this." Mihoshi asked as she held the purse as instructed and gave to quick taps to it.
Washu looked over her shoulder, her eyes widened with fear as she saw Mihoshi reaching for 
the clasp 

"Mihoshi, NOOOO!" Washu screamed as Mihoshi opened the purse.

   ---FWOOSH--- 

Washu suddenly found herself buried completely beneath a pile of assorted items, as 
she struggled to free herself from the avalanche of junk one final object bounced off of 
her head. Looking down she realized it was a class three GP issue concussion grenade. 
Nothing extremely dangerous, unless of course it was handled by 

"Mihoshi!" Washu screamed. The blonde haired detective sat atop the pile of misbegotten 
rubbish pondering a small object caught on her finger.

"Now where did this ring come from?" she asked herself. 

Washu quickly glanced down at the grenade as it lay on the floor at the base of the pile. 
Fear came quickly as she realized the source of Mihoshi's mysterious new jewelry. 'Oh dear' 
she thought to herself as the grenade erupted into a shockwave sending her and the pile of 
debris across the lab only to stop at a far wall. Mihoshi however landed with a light thud 
as the pile was taken out from under her. 

"Ouch." she said tentatively as she got up rubbing her backside. A small slip of paper 
floated down and landed lightly across her nose. Mihoshi took the paper from her nose and 
her eyes widened as she realized what it was. "This is it, I found it." she squealed 
gleefully "Oh thank you Washu thank you." Mihoshi quickly raced from the lab back to the 
kitchen to make her call. 

"Don't mention it." Washu growled as she lay upside down amidst a pile of junk against the 
far wall."

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Kagato allowed his mind to drift, much like his newly forming body drifted amidst the green 
fluid of the regeneration vat. Who was Lady Tokimi and why was she going through the trouble
of regenerating his mind and body. 'She intends to use me as a tool.' he thought to himself 
'But to what end. Bah no matter I'll play her little game but after I've seized the power of 
Tsunami there will be a reckoning.' More memories flooded into his mind as he sought to 
recover his mind from the abyss. 'First however there will be a reckoning with the boy who 
caused this.' Kagato took pleasure in plotting a suitable demise for Tenchi a death fit for 
the crown prince of Jurai. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

"Well how do I look?" Mihoshi asked as she came down the stairs. She wore a full length 
black evening gown, split up the left side. It bore a crimson ruffled top with no shoulders.
Her shoes were off white accented with what looked to be genuine pearls. Around her neck she 
sported a black diamond necklace. Her hair flowed around her in loose rings about the sides 
and the back was braided into a single flowing ponytail accented with miniature red crystal 
roses. 

"Wow Mihoshi you look great." Sasami said practically beaming admiration toward Mihoshi. 
Kiyone sat dumbfounded in the armchair next to the couch. Ayeka came down the stairs behind 
her and was in turn followed by a very bleary eyed Ryoko. "Well Kiyone how do I look." 
implored her uncertain partner. 

"I don't know what to say Mihoshi." Kiyone stated, "You look beautiful." 

"Oh thank you Kiyone." she squealed as she embraced her partner in her trademark bear hug. 

"Your welcome Mihoshi." Kiyone gasped
"Now please let me go so I can breathe."

"Where is Lord Katsuhito?" questioned Ayeka. Sasami spun around to face her sister 

"Grandfather is in the lab with Washu, They're waiting for Mr. Arkain to wake up, 
grandfather has asked to be the first one to speak to him." 

"I see." replied Ayeka "Someone needs to make a good excuse as to why Ryoko attacked him 
last night." 

Ryoko fell back into the couch "Can we not bring up last night, at least not yet, please." 
she groaned as she clutched her throbbing head. "I didn't mean to attack him, it was a 
reflex I thought he was Kagato." Ayeka remembering Ryoko's breakdown afterwards decided not 
to press the issue further. 

'In all honesty.' she thought to herself silently 'I might have done the same had our roles 
been reversed.' 

"Mihoshi are you sure you gave him the correct coordinates for Washu's beacon." Kiyone asked
glancing at the clock. As if in response the unmistakable thunder of a spaceship could be 
heard just over the rooftop. 

"Yup, I'm sure." Mihoshi said with pride. 

"Well I'm going down to the lab to speak with Grandfather." Ayeka said with a curt bow. 
"Do have fun Mihoshi and please be careful." 

"Thank you Ayeka I will." Mihoshi said with a giggle. 

As Ayeka disappeared into the lab a knock was heard at the back door. "I'll get it." Sasami 
chimed gleefully.

Tevan switched his navcom over to autopilot as the ship descended into the atmosphere of 
the only inhabitable in the system. 'I can't believe I'm doing this.' he thought to himself 
'Mercenaries don't date Galaxy Police officers, hell mercenaries aren't supposed to date.' 
He stood up from the pilot's chair and paced slowly on his ships small bridge. His shoulders
sagged slightly and his head dropped as memories of his past came back to him.
He grew up in a pirate colony in a backwater system along one of the the main Jurian trade 
routes. He had always thought he should have been more than the son of a pirate. He always 
thought there should have been more to his life than helping hijack merchant vessels bound 
for Jurian inner space. Tevan wanted more he wanted purpose not mindless ransacking. He 
wanted to be a somebody not just another someone on a wanted poster. He definitely wanted 
to be wanted but not because a price was on his head. He wanted to be acknowledged as being 
more than he was. On his nineteenth birthday his father gave him just that he gave him his 
identity. He told him of his true heritage. He was not born Tevan Dazorn son of a space 
pirate, he was born Tevan Dazorn first son of an exiled Jurian noble, why his father had 
been stripped of his title was never told to him. But it didn't matter he now had an identity
he was no longer the son of a common space pirate the was the son of an ex-noble turned 
space pirate. He vowed soon that all of Jurai would tremble at the mention of his name. 
Then he learned the truth and he was left wanting once more. Jurai it turned out had been 
founded by space pirates, who had grown tired of the endless conflict they faced daily. A 
handful had found a remote planet in a desolate system; the planet had been uninhabited 
except for its huge forests and myriad animal species. And so it was here that the pirates 
turned colonist chose to settle. A few hundred millennia later Jurai was the center of a 
vast galactic empire. A planet of pristine beauty and militaristic force. One would never 
know the truth unless one took care to dig very deep. While his father had been exiled from 
the planet itself he had not been exiled from his duties. So as Tevan discovered the pirate 
colony he belonged to was actually part of the Jurian military responsible for search and 
seizure of contraband. He found himself at a loss so he struck out on his own and began to 
carve for himself his place in history. 'Whooo yeah really big place.' Tevan mused to himself
 sarcastically 'Tevan Dazorn, mercenary turned small time salvage man. With an occasional 
job under the tables here and there.' That invitation to join the Independent Galactic 
Investigation Squad or IGI was starting to look pretty good.
Suddenly the proximity alarm sounded and jarred him from thought. 'Almost ready to land, 
better switch back to manual.' He thought as he eased into the pilot's chair. As he took 
the control his thoughts turned to Mihoshi. She was beautiful, cheerful, and always happy. 
Maybe he needed someone like that to help him see what he was rather than what he could 
have been 'Or maybe I'm just hard up.' he thought sarcastically once more. "Oh well." he 
exclaimed to no one "A little dapper and a lot of flair and we'll sweep this lovely lady 
right off her feet." He took his cloak from the back of his chair and exited the ship.

Sasami opened the back door and stood in awe. Tevan stood before her in all the splendor he 
could afford to muster, he was pretty impressive. He wore a black enameled suited etched 
in silver. His cloak was held atop his shoulders by clasps made of the finest pristine faux 
emeralds. And his trusted energy scythes hung at the ready on each side of his waist. 
Tevan looked down and grinned sheepishly 

"Uhm... Does Mihoshi live here." he asked nervously. Sasami's stunned expression was quickly
replaced with one of Joyous envy. 

"Mihoshi your date is here." she said with a giggle. 

"Oh no..." came Mihoshi's voice from the living room "Do I look alright." 

"You look fine Mihoshi. If that dress I gave you doesn't wow him then he's probably dead." 
came an unfamiliar voice. 

"Thank you again Ryoko." he heard Mihoshi reply 'Ryoko where have I heard that name before..." 
Tevan lost his train of thought as Mihoshi stepped into the kitchen. Tevan felt his jaw 
drop as he looked upon Mihoshi; he quickly regained composure and laid on his charm. 

"My dear lady I seek a noble woman true, but I did not expect to be greeted by a goddess of 
such splendor and beauty." 

"Flatterer." Mihoshi said blushing a bright shade of pink. A commotion was heard in the 
living room as two heads peeked around the corner and four eyes grew wide in amazement. 

"Well beautiful." Tevan said as he extended his arm to Mihoshi "Shall we be off." Mihoshi 
took him by the arm 

"Yes by all means." she said with slight bit of elation to her voice. "Bye everyone see you 
later." Mihoshi said as the couple exited the back door toward Tevan's ship.

"Wow." breathed Ryoko he was some looker. Kiyone merely leapt up into the air 

"Yipee she finally gone." the teal haired woman squealed "Finally some peace and quiet and 
a chance to relax." 

Ryoko and Sasami both began laughing. Suddenly the back door flew open and Mihoshi came 
rushing in. She stopped short when she entered the living room and set her purse on the 
coffee table 

"C'mon guys his suits not that tacky is it." she asked with a look of worry.
The laughter abruptly stopped 

"No Mihoshi it's not that at all." Kiyone said apologetically "By the way is something wrong." 

"Oh yeah I almost forgot." she answered as she dashed off upstairs only to return a moment 
later clutching a wad of yellow fabric "I forgot my swimsuit." she giggled "Tevan says I 
might need it." she shouted as she raced out the door. 

"Where does he plan on taking her?" Ryoko asked "scuba diving." 

"I have no idea." Kiyone replied "and that's what bother's me." 

Suddenly the back door burst open again as Mihoshi raced in "Silly me I forgot my purse." 
she explained. 

"Mihoshi where is he taking you that you need a swimsuit." Kiyone asked 

"Oh he's taking me to Alcen Five in the Alpha Centuari system." Mihoshi answered as she 
raced again out the back door.

Soon there after the unmistakable roar of engines firing for liftoff could be heard, soon 
all was quiet. 

"Now we can celebrate." Kiyone said flatly. 

"I'll get the sake." Ryoko stated as she disappeared from view. 

"We'll I'm going to start dinner." Sasami announced as she walked back into the kitchen 
"Washu said Mister Arkain would be up and around this evening and grandfather said he would 
probably be hungry."

Ryoko reappeared with two bottles of sake and two cups. "Here we go." she exclaimed as her 
and Kiyone settled in to do a bit of drinking and relaxation. The silence was interrupted 
by the familiar sounds of retro rockets being fired to adjust for a landing. Kiyone dropped 
her face to her hands and sobbed 

"What is it this time." she looked up her frustration replaced by anger as three sharp 
knocks were heard at the front door. Kiyone stormed to the door and flung it open 
"For heaven's sake what is it this time Miho...." While the person who stood before her 
was a member of the Galaxy Police he was most certainly not Mihoshi.

The strange officer quickly snapped to attention and saluted crisply.
"Officer second class Remy Lamadin. At your service ma'am."


---------------------------------------------------------------------

Kagato floated listlessly in the regeneration vat. His mind drifted 
Once more as memories came to him, he allowed them to overtake him.
Soon his past played back before him like a waking dream.

"You clumsy oaf, watch what your doing!" Kagato bellowed at a worker
carrying a large crate of equipment. The workman had tripped and almost dropped the box 
containing a sonar drill. 

"Sorry sir I'll be more careful." the worker replied as he hurried into the next chamber 
with the crate. 

'If those fools at the academy had given me a larger budget I wouldn't have had to hire 
brutes.' he thought to himself disgustedly Why had he come here, on a whim based off an 
old file he found while searching through the academy database that listed this site as an 
ancient temple of a forgotten civilization? Or was it because the file mentioned that the 
temple was rumored to contain the wings of the goddess. An artifact that supposedly 
contained great power. Perhaps both old ruins and objects of power were his favorite 
pastimes.
'Perhaps I may find them.' he mused 'Then I'll use them to show those fools at the academy 
what true power really is. After of course I eliminate Professor Washu.' Hatred seethed 
from his very being at the thought of her. Surprisingly she had been overly supportive of 
his idea to explore and catalog these ruins. 
'Hah' he thought 'She wanted me gone so she could hog the spotlight with her "Greatest 
Creation" whatever that might be.' He walked back out to the main chamber and stared down 
at a large pool still filled with water. He stared down at his reflection, he was the son 
of a respected nobleman why should he be mocked by a foolish professor who ranked so low 
she couldn't keep her husband or child, she was common rabble how dare she think herself 
his better. 'One day. I'll put her in her place.' His thoughts were interrupted as a worker 
approached him. 

"We're ready for you sir." he said. 

"Excellent." Kagato replied as he followed to man back to the adjoining chamber. Kagato 
marveled anew at the interior of the temple. Unlike the outside, which had been ravaged by 
vandals and the effects of the atmosphere for several millenniums, the inside of the temple 
had somehow managed to remain undisturbed. It unnerved him to say the least,
something was here to prevent looters but what and where. 'No matter.'
Kagato thought to himself 'Soon I'll be done with this place and these wretched brutes.' 
Kagato surveyed the chamber three plain walls and an archway which led to the chamber with 
the pool, preliminary sonar readings had reported that one of the walls was indeed false 
and opened into a smaller chamber. That chamber contained the object he sought, if
it was even real. Kagato seated himself behind the console of the sonar drill. He proceeded 
to place several small holes in key fault points along the surface of the wall. As he 
finished the workers began placing explosive charges inside, as they did so Kagato walked 
up to oversee placement of the charges. 

"Careful you dolts, one slip know and we all cease to exists." He roared. A smile crossed 
his lips as he watched the faces around him grow pale. He ran his hand along the surface of 
the wall, it was smooth to the touch, to smooth to have been done by hand he guessed. As 
his hand reached the hole where a charge was placed it happened. Whether the accident was 
caused by a clumsy worker, a faulty charge, or just a macabre twist of fate he never found 
out. All he could remember was a blinding flash, a rush of air, and the coldness of the water. 
The blast had blown him through the archway and into the pool.Which he then discovered was 
inhabited by a creature called Mass.
Kagato awoke later outside the pool very much alive, although his body ached he felt fine. 

"How in the name of all things did I survive?" he asked to no one as he surveyed the damage 
around him. Scattered corpses and severed limbs were strewn about all around the chamber. 
Kagato stood in sheer horror as he realized on of the limbs lying at his feet was in fact 
his own severed arm. 'But how?' he thought then he realized the mass had assimilated with 
his own body. He would later learn that is was his will for living that had caused them to 
do so. He would also learn that they had caused other changes in him as well. But for the 
moment all he could do was stare at the arm that once was his and until recently had 
adorned his left shoulder. His gaze was torn away as a green light bathed the room. As he 
peered through the rubble he saw that the wall no longer remained it had indeed opened to a 
smaller chamber. Inside this chamber was a pedestal and on this pedestal he saw it. A 
golden statue of a bird with its wings outstretched it crest was adorned with three green 
gems the wings of the goddess was his at last.
