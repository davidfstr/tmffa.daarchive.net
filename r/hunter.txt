Note:  This story takes   place somewhere in the Tenchi TV universe, 
but I'm not really sure where.  I had the fight scene very well 
planned, but everything else was writen on the fly.  What do you think?

		Tenchi Muyo!  Another Hunter
		By: Luke 'Skywalker' Tixier



	Two surprisingly similar ships hung in space waiting in a deadly
face-off.  On one side Ryoko and Ryo-oh-ki stood ready, and on the 
other Gen and Jin-oh-ki were looking for another prize.  But in this 
fight Gen had an advantage: He had Tenchi.


*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*


	"What do you want and what have you done with Tenchi?!" Ryoko 
growled.
	Gen grinned, "Tenchi?  Oh, you mean the earthling.  I've done 
nothing to him...  yet," he said, "As for what I want, I want you 
Ryoko, dead or alive."
	"Like hell," Ryoko hissed.
	He grinned again, "I thought you'd say something like that.  
It's been awhile since I've had a good fight.  Do you think you can give
me one?"
	"You're damn right I can!" Ryoko glared at him, "RYO-OH-KI 
FIRE!!!"
	A barrage of red energy lanced toward Jin-oh-ki, but it never made 
contact.  The shields easily deflected Ryoko's attack.
	"Is that the best you've got?" asked Gen disappointingly, "Maybe 
this won't be as much of a fight as I'd hoped."
	"I'll give you a fight, you bastard!" yelled Ryoko as she turned
off the comm. system off.  "Ryo-oh-ki full speed ahead."    


*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*


	  Gen was taken by surprise at Ryoko's apparent suicide maneuver.  
< Uh-oh, > he thought, < I didn't think she'd do something like this. >
	He looked up at the viewscreen to see Ryo-oh-ki racing closer.
	"Jin-oh-ki, can you open her communication system?" Gen asked.
	"Raaaaa," confidently replied the ship.
	"Then do it!  Avoid that attack.  And get that prisoner up to the  
bridge." 
	Seconds later, Tenchi materialized next to Gen, just in time to 
be violently thrown to the floor by Ryo-oh-ki's collision.  Gen
stumbled, but managed to stay on his feet.  He grabbed a bound and 
dazed Tenchi,and yelled, "Get me communications, NOW!"
	"Raaaaaa," answered the ship angrily as the image of Ryoko appeared.
	"Ryoko," Gen said coolly to get her attention.
	She glanced up at the screen and turned extremely pale.  
"Tenchiiii...," She gasped, "Ryo-oh-ki cease the attack." 	
	"Miyyaaaa," replied the ship, reversed course, and stopped a short 
distance away.
	Gen smiled, "Good. I have your attention."
	"I'll make you pay," Ryoko threatened, "if you hurt Tenchi."
	"Yes, I'm sure you will."
	< If I attack, > thought Ryoko, < he'll kill Tenchi.  So what do I do? >
	Trying the only option she could think of, Ryoko growled, 
"I thought you wanted a fight?"
	"Yes, and I still do, but just to powerful I the air," Gen smiled.
	Ryoko smiled at the comment, "Yeah, Ryo-oh-ki and I are pretty 
unstoppable, I'll admit."
	Without warning, a tremendously powerful blast rocked Ryo-oh-ki.  
It fractured and broke many of her exterior crystals, and left her 
'dead' in space.
	"Damn," Ryoko swore, "Where the hell did that come from?"
	"Miii... yyyyaaaa," struggled the cabbit.
	"We can't take another shot like that," Ryoko said as she scanned 
over some read-outs, "Hell, we can't take another hit, period."  
	"Miiiyyyaaaa," Ryo-oh-ki asked exhaustedly.
	"Well there's only one option left."


*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*


	Gen looked at the helpless ship and laughed,  "Pathetic."
	"Was it now?" answered a voice.
	"Huh...?" He said before he was caught in the jaw with a swift 
punch.  Gen reeled backwards as another punch connected with his gut.  
He fell to his knees, short of breath, and received a stunning kick 
to his chest.  Gen flew across the bridge, and skidded to a halt  
against a wall, where he lost conscienceness.


*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	


	Ryoko, who had teleported aboard ( If you hadn't guessed. :-) ), 
turned away from the incapacitated heap of a man.  She found Tenchi 
lying on the deck, where Gen had dropped him.
	"Tenchi?  Tenchi are you okay?  Your not hurt, are you?" asked 
Ryoko.	
	Tenchi sluggishly turned toward her, muttering something she 
couldn't understand.
	< He's in better condition than I expected, > thought Ryoko, 
< He just has a few bruises from when he'd been captured, a 
bloody nose from Ryoko's collision attack, and some ill effects from 
some sort of sedative that Gen had used. >  Ryoko sighed, feeling 
very relieved.


*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	


	Gen slowly regained conscienceness and his senses.  He shook 
his head and looked to see where Ryoko had gone since he was still 
alive.  He saw her hunched over the earthling boy he had captured.
	Ryoko was so engrossed in caring for Tenchi that she never 
knew Gen was up and walking towards her.
	"Tragic," he muttered.  < She used to be so good in a fight. 
But now she's so enraptured with this boy that she's let her guard 
down completely. > He sighed.  < What would make her risk her life 
for him?  Oh well, it just makes my job easier. >
	Gen approached Ryoko stealthily until he was standing only a
few feet from her.  He drew his arm back, activated his energy-
sword, and swung.


*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	


	The instant Ryoko heard the hum of energy her reflexes kicked 
in.  In one fluid move, she stood up, turned, and activated her own
energy-sword.  But she wasn't quick enough to avoid the attack.
	Gen's sword gouged a deep wound in Ryoko's right thigh, instead 
of separating her at the torso, as Gen had anticipated.
	Ryoko yelped in pain as she danced back a few steps, using her 
powers of levitation to keep from collapsing.
	"You've lost your edge over the years, Ryoko," Gen taunted, 
"But at least you were quick enough to avoid my attack...   somewhat."
	"Shut up," Ryoko snapped, holding her thigh.    
	"You still have some spirit left.  That's good.  This might be 
interesting after all."
	"I said SHUT UP!!!!" she shouted, and charged Gen, energy-sword 
raised for attack.
	But that attack never came.  Instead just before she was to 
strike, she dematerialized, and reappeared directly behind Gen, and 
swung in the same moment.  It was a perfectly planned attack, and would 
have ended the fight, but Gen was no longer there.  He floated about 
ten feet directly above Ryoko.
	"Where'd...?" was all she could mutter before heard the hum of 
energy above her.  She looked up and jumped backwards in time to 
avoid being blow to bits by the yellow energy blot that lanced to 
towards her.
	The ship whined in protest as the energy bolts exploded on the 
deck.  Behind Ryoko, several of the ships' crystals rushed forward.  
Ryoko sidestepped left and right slashing each crystal as the whizzed 
past.  The crystals wobbled forward before they exploded into clouds 
of smoke.
	Gen soared through the smoke, ready to fight.  He speared for 
Ryoko's head, who easily dodged it, and answered with an attack of 
her own.  Gen parried the blows and backed away.
	Ryoko darted after him.  Gen hovered just beyond Ryoko's 
reach, so she fired several blasts of energy at him.  Gen ducked 
and teleported out of the way.  Ryoko's bolts exploded against the 
walls and crystals, causing large plumes of smoke to fill the bridge.


*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	


	Tenchi began to recover from the effects of the sedative.  
He leaned against a wall on a bridge, which looked similar to 
Ryo-oh-ki's.  Tenchi could see a red blade and yellow blade clash 
together and dart apart in a thick cloud of smoke.
	Finally, something in his head clicked, "Ryoko..."
	Tenchi tried to stand, but he was still too weak.  So he watched 
helplessly as the battle raged on in front of him.


*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*


	The combatants had been fighting for over an hour, and were 
getting tired.  Neither opponent was able to gain an advantage.
	Ryoko back-flipped to avoid Gen's swipe.  She grimaced as 
her wounded leg gave out under her weight.
	Gen saw his opening.  Rushing forward, he brought his sword 
around and gouged another large wound in Ryoko's left leg.
	Again she yelped in pain, and fell to her knees.  Gen delivered 
a powerful kick directly to her face, sending Ryoko flying across the 
room.


*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	


	Tenchi was still lying against the wall, watching the battle 
when he saw Ryoko careen out of the smoke.  While she hurled through 
the air, Ryoko lost hold of her sword.  Which embedded itself into 
Ryoko's right side, as she slammed into a wall.  A small gurgle came
from Ryoko as she slid down the wall leaving behind a trail of blood.
	"Noooo!!" screamed Tenchi. He heaved himself to his feet, only 
to collapses onto his face.  He glanced up and saw Gen had his sword 
to Ryoko's throat.  Summoning all his strength, Tenchi lunged up and 
charged forward.
	"Ryoko!"
	Gen turned and launched several bolts at Tenchi  they exploded
right in front of Tenchi and sent him flying.
	"Nooo," bawled Ryoko as she saw Tenchi thrown bodily in to 
the air.
	Despite all her pain, Ryoko lunged forward at Gen only to be 
thrown to the ground with a well executed hip-toss.  And again Gen 
had his sword at her throat.
	"You're not going to escape that easy," he said.
	Ryoko tried to back away but received a backhand slap for her 
efforts.
	She glared at him but didn't have the energy or the strength
to make any sort of attack.
	Ryoko heard Tenchi's voice, "No, Ryoko." It sounded incredibly 
strained.  She glanced towards him.  Blood ran from his nose and 
mouth.
	She looked around, desperately looking for a way to escape.  
She tried to slide left and right but her sword prevented her from 
doing so, nor could she back away.
	< No escape this time. > Ryoko thought sadly.  She looked at 
Tenchi, his eyes full of despair because he couldn't save her.
	Gen drew his sword back.
	"Goodbye, Tenchi," she whispered.  Ryoko closed her eyes 
and cried.  Ryoko waited for death to come.  She waited < I wish
we could have been together, Tenchi. > and waited < Good bye, my 
love. > but nothing came.
	Surprised, Ryoko looked up. She saw Gen with his arm raised,
but there was a blade at his throat.  Over his shoulder she could 
see Tenchi's face, full of determination.
	Ryoko gave a weak smile, while her heart soared.  < I will 
get to be with Tenchi. >
	"I can't let you do that," he said sternly to Gen.
	"Why not?" Gen asked scornfully.
	"Because I love her."
	Ryoko nearly dropped dead at those words.  < Did I hear him 
right?  * I don't care. *  He SAID he .......   loves....  me. >
	"And how are you going to stop me?" smirked Gen.
	Tenchi waved his sword in front of Gen's face.  Using this 
opportunity, Gen teleported behind Tenchi.
	"What..?"
	Gen raked his sword across Tenchi's back.
	"Aaaaaarrrrrrrgggggg!!" Tenchi screamed, and collapsed into 
Ryoko's arms.
	"Nooooo!!"  yelled Ryoko.  As he collapsed so did her dreams 
of being with Tenchi.  She cradled the boy that just said he loved
her.  The boy she'd loved since the day they'd met.  Ryoko was 
filled with total despair.
	Gen laughed, "So that's the power of love.  Didn't do him 
or you any good, did it?"
	Ryoko glared up at him, her despair turned to pure rage.  
Her whole body shook violently.
	She teleported Tenchi aboard Ryo-oh-ki, and placed him in 
the command chair.  "Ryo-oh-ki get Tenchi to Washu."
	She looked back down at Tenchi......   and kissed him.  Ryoko 
held the kiss not wanting it to end.  No matter how long she held 
the kiss, it would have been to short for Ryoko.  She broke the 
kiss and straightened up.  A single tear fell onto Tenchi's cheek 
before Ryoko teleported back aboard Jin-oh-ki.


*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*


	Gen was waiting on the bridge when Ryoko appeared.
	"It's about time.  Did you really love him that much?  That's 
not like you,"  he taunted.
	"I'll show you how much I loved him!!!"


*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*


	Despite Gen's valiant efforts, the battle didn't last very 
long.  In the end there wasn't much left of Gen or his ship.


*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	


	Ryoko floated through space towards Earth, thinking about Tenchi, 
hoping (and praying) that he would survive.  Of course, she could have 
teleported directly to the Misaki house, but she was afraid that Tenchi 
might be dead.  And now that he had admitted he loved her, it would have
been worse to lose him now.< Don't die, Tenchi.  Please don't die. > 
Ryoko thought before she teleported home.

That's the end of this story. This is my first fanfic of any kind.  So what 
did you think?  Please send your comments to GAThrawn81@aol.com.  I'm 
considering writing a prequel to this story, to give more background, and 
maybe a sequel (I'm not sure.  That's not really my type of writing).  
Feel free to recommend any ideas.
