No Need For Zero-Part 3
No Need For Another Lover

	"Sasami, you've really outdone yourself again!!  How do you manage 
to cook such wonderful food?!?!"
	"Hehe, thank you grandfather!"
	"He's right Sasami!  How do you manage this?"
	"Well Tenchi, I pick food everyone likes and throw it in a pot!!  
Hehehe"
	"Well, you heard her, lets eat!!!" With that the spring 
celebration started.  There was food on every table in every form!  
Music was playing and laughter was heard.  Games were being played and 
everyone was happy....except one person.
	(Look at him, laughing with her!  She doesn't deserve him!  I've 
survived their little coziness with each other for a year now, and I 
can't help but want Tenchi even more!!  I can't believe this!)  Ayeka, 
hiding in the shadows of the stairs, was crying at the scene before her.  
(I have no part in this celebration!)  She left for the lake outside in 
a rush, but careful enough that no one saw her. (One day he'll wake up 
and realize what he missed with her instead of me!  I should be happy 
for him, but...*sob* she's not worth it!!)  She began crying 
uncontrolably on the edge of the lake.  (I should just throw myself in 
the lake...no one would care...!  But,... I wouldnt be able to kill 
myself with Tenchi still around...I live just to see him...but not with 
her!!!)  She stood up and walked to knee deep in the lake, hesitating 
whether or not to jump in.  (I got it!  If I pretend to be drowning, he 
will come and rescue me, that would distract him from Ryoko!)  With that 
she mentally prepared herself for the cold water.  Ayeka jumped in the 
lake and began screaming for help.
	"HELP!! SOME ONE!!!! I CAN'T SWIM!!! HELP!!!"
	From inside the Masaki house...
	"What is that screaming?"
	"Tenchi! Tenchi!  Ayeka is drowning! She can't swim!  Help 
her!!!!"  Cried Sasami.  Tenchi, and the gang rushed outside to see 
Ayeka splashing for help in the lake, periodically disappearing under 
the water.
	"Ayeka!  Hold on!"
	"Tenchi, I'll get her!"
	"No, Ryoko stay here!"  Tenchi threw off his shirt and dove into 
the black, icy water of the lake.  (Ayeka...where are you?)  He rose to 
the surface to catch his breath when all he saw was wispy strands of 
purple hair sinking to bottom of the lake.  (AYEKA!!)  Ryoko, on the 
shore, could sense his distress, and was hesitating to jump in after 
him.  Tenchi panically searched for Ayeka's body, when his foot hit 
something in the water.  He turned quickly and found Ayeka suspended in 
the water next to him.  He grabbed her waist and tried to swim as fast 
as his wobbly legs could carry him. He soon felt the air running low in 
his lungs, and began to panic.  Up ahead he could see the light of the 
moon shining bright.  He burst threw the top of the water, gasping for 
breath, and still holding Ayeka.  He brought her head out of the water, 
as he heard her coughing and also gasping for breath.  
	"Ayeka!!"  Sasami cried.  Tenchi slowly swam to the edge of the 
lake and placed Ayeka on the ground.  He prayed that she was conscious 
and could breath.  Ayeka coughed up water and slowly opened her eyes.
	"Te..Tenchi?"
	"Oh Ayeka!!!  Tenchi, you saved her!"  Sasami then glomped her 
older sister with happiness.
	"Hey, Sasami, I'm okay...*cough* *cough*"
	"Tenchi, could you carry Ayeka to her room, she needs sleep"
	"Sure Sasami."  Tenchi carefully picked up Ayeka in his arms and 
started up the path to the house.  Ayeka hid a smile and wrapped her 
arms around Tenchi and placed her head on his chest.
	"Oh, Tenchi, you saved me.  Thank..."  She then "passed out"  
(Poor Ayeka, she must be really scared and tired, I should stay with her 
tonight incase she wakes up scared) He walked in the house, and carried 
her upstairs to her room.  He carefully placed her on her bed and sat on 
the floor next to her.  He then brushed the hair of her face, and got 
comfortable on the floor.  (It's going to be a long day...)  Ayeka 
coughed and sighed and got up, "looking confused" 
	"Where am I?  Tenchi why are you here?  Why are my clothes wet?"
	"Ayeka...don't you remember?  You fell in the lake?"
	"Oh...yes...Tenchi, I'm so cold...."
	"You have wet cloths on...here" He handed her his shirt, and 
turned around.  Ayeka quickly changed and got under the sheets.
	"Thank you Tenchi."
	"Your welcome Ayeka, you should get some sleep."  Of course with 
the excitement of what happened Ayeka wasn't near tired.  She was a 
little wiped out from swallowing water...that wasn't planned.  She 
pretended to go to sleep for a bit and then got up crying.
	"Ayeka...what's wrong?"
	"I'm so scared!!! I thought I was going to die!  If you didn't 
come, Tenchi, I would have died."  She cried.
	"Ayeka, don't worry, I'm here" With that, he climbed next to her 
and held her tight as if to keep her worries out.  Ayeka after crying a 
little still ended up falling asleep in his arms and so did Tenchi.  (My 
Tenchi, this is what is real!  You and me as one!  If only I could make 
this last....)
	The Next Morning
	(Another day of surviving Tenchi's love for Ryoko...wait, wasn't 
he here with me?)  She noticed that Tenchi was gone and she was alone in 
her room.  She sighed and got changed.  Then she stepped out of room and 
smelled Sasami's cooking downstairs.
	"Oh Good Morning Ayeka!  We missed you at breakfast!"
	"I missed breakfast?"
	"Yes, Kiyone, and Mihoshi went on patrol, Mr. Masaki is at work, 
Grandfather is in the shrine, and Ryoko and Tenchi went into town for 
some groceries.
	(*sigh* Ryoko is still with Tenchi...)
	"Well, I'm going to the shrine to think some things out."
	"Ayeka..."
	"Yes?"
	"I'm glad you're ok.."  Ayeka then walked out very slowly to the 
steps of the shrine.  (I have to think of something.....)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~
	"Tenchi?"
	"Ya, Ryoko?"
	"What did Sasami want us to get?"
	"Um, here's the list."
	"Thanx....so...what happened last night?"
	"Well Ayeka kept waking up and crying so stayed by her bed and I 
guess I fell asleep,"
	"Oh...,  Tenchi?  Do you think Ayeka fell into the lake?"
	"What?!?!"
	"Well, I thought she could swim, and all..and"
	"Ryoko, I don't think she would do that on purpose."
	"Your right Tenchi.  Hey I'm hungry, lets get something to eat!"
	"K," So they walked into a small restaurant.
	"You get a menu, and I'll find a table."  Ryoko searched around 
for a perfect place for lunch.  (There!)
	"Ryoko, where did...oh!  Here you are."  Ryoko leaned on the table 
seductively and grabbed his shirt to pull him closer.
	"I missed you last night...." she said 
	"Uh..I missed you too."
	"You owe me something..."
	"An apology??"
	"No!  This!"  She pulled him closer and kissed him with a longing 
passion.  Tenchi finally broke away when people started to stare at 
them.
	"Uh...here's the menus."
	"Thanx!  Wow, they have good food here, I wonder if it's as good 
as Sasami's cooking?"
	"Probably not!"  They laughed.
	"Tenchi...do you think...Ayeka still wishes she was with you and 
not me...?"
	"Ryoko, I don't know what she thinks, but what ever it is, it 
doesn't matter to me.  Nothing she could do would change my feelings!"
	"Ok," she blushes and reaches in for a quick kiss.
	"Wow! I'm starving!  Let's order!"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	(I must think of a way to bring Tenchi and me closer...I felt him 
care for me last night when he thought I was scared...what could I do?  
No matter what the costs I must change Tenchi's mind...  Even...if it 
means.... stooping to Ryoko's level....) She sat on the steps near 
Tenchi's training grounds.  She remembered when she first came here, and 
watched Tenchi.  She cut her leg and Tenchi carried her to a shed when 
it started to rain.  (He carried me, like then...) She began to cry 
again. (Woh, I'm starving...Sasami is probably finished with lunch by 
now!)  So she headed off toward the Masaki house.
	"Oh Ayeka! Lunch is ready!"
	"Great Sasami, I was just coming to see if it was."  So Ayeka and 
Sasami sat down to eat lunch, when Kiyone came in yelling at Mihoshi who 
was crying her eyes out.
	"Gee, Kiyone I didn't mean to knock over those dishes!"
	"Mihoshi!  Ugh!  You're always so clumsy!!"
	"Hey Kiyone and Mihoshi, you guys want some lunch?"
	"No, that's ok, Mihoshi just knocked over the dishes from the 
restaurant we were at, and we had to pay for them...so.."
	"Hey Thanx, Sasami.  I'm starving!"
	"ERRRR!"
	"You can have some too Kiyone!"
	"MIHOSHI!!!"
	"Hey what's all this yelling about? I thought all of that was 
over, now that I was with Tenchi!  Hehehe"
	"Hi Ryoko, hey Tenchi!"  
	"Ya, hi..." Ayeka scorned.  (Does she have to push out that!)?
	"Tenchi, what time were our reservations for?"
	"Uh...5:30 I believe."
	"Ok...so that gives me 3 hours of free time!!! YAY!!! hehe..I'm 
going to take a walk outside...want to come?"
	"I'll be out in a bit."
	"So how was shopping Lord Tenchi?"
	"Uh..fine I guess....not very exciting.."
	"Yes..."
	"Um...Ayeka, are you ok today?'	
	"Yes...I should think so,...I had a little trouble earlier...but 
nothing big....just (think of something)...fell down the stairs of the 
shrine.."
	"WHAT?!?!?!"
	"Well...I don't even hurt much...and..."
	"Ayeka!  What happened?"
	"Well..I was walking up the stairs, when I paused to look out, and 
I saw the lake, and froze from fright.  So when I started to go up the 
stairs again, still looking at the lake, I slipped on a puddle and fell 
down some stairs."
	"Ayeka...you should stay indoors for a while..in fact...I'm going 
to stay here with you, tonight to make sure you're ok."
	"Oh but wouldn't that interfere with Ryoko?"
	"She'll understand..."
	"Thanx, Tenchi!"  (....HA HA I did it!! I can't believe this!!  
He's spending time with me over a date with Ryoko!  I wonder what will 
happen tonight...)
	"I'm going to find Ryoko, and explain...you get comfortable and 
get out a game or something."  He then left to go find Ryoko and tell 
her the news.
	"Ryoko!  Ryoko!"  He then spotted her under the cherry blossom 
trees, her favorite.  (Wow, she's so beautiful, I feel bad breaking this 
to her...we haven't had a peaceful date since...well...i don't know!!)
	"Hey Tenchi...decided to join me?'
	"Well...I thought maybe we could postpone the date tonight, to 
another date?"  He suddenly saw a mixture of thoughts in her 
eyes...fear, shock, pain, anger, and confusion all mixed in one...
	"Wh...why?"
	"Well, Ayeka fell down the stairs to the shrine today, and she is 
still a bit unstable, and I wanted to stay here with her tonight to make 
sure she's ok."
	"Oh...ok...well I guess I could stay here with you...or go out 
myself."
	"But, you're ok with this?"
	"Yes, Tenchi, If you feel you should stay with Ayeka, then so be 
it..."  She then turned her face to hide her tears of pain and fear of 
loosing Tenchi.  She walked to her favorite tree and sat down.
	"Well, I should get back to the house, Ayeka is waiting for me."  
Then he left.
	(So this is what dismiss feels like....Why now!?!  Why is spending 
more time with Ayeka than me?  *sob*  I just wanted a peaceful date with 
him!  Ayeka is so up to something!!!  She's been hanging around him more 
often and getting his attention more!  Maybe I'll join them....)  Then 
she flew off to the Masaki house to see what Ayeka was up to.  When she 
approached the house, she looked in and saw Ayeka laughing with Tenchi 
and laying on him.  (How...could he!?!?)  She walked in the house and 
looked directly at Ayeka, who straightened up but kept "flirting" with 
Tenchi.
	"Lord Tenchi, you're so funny!  Heheh" she giggled.
	"Hey Tenchi, I felt like joining you guys and having some fun 
too!"
	"Wow Ryoko that's great!  Come here, we were going to play 
"SORRY""  Ryoko went over, kissed him quickly, right in Ayeka's face, 
and sat next to him.
	"Hey Ayeka!"
	"Hello...Miss Ryoko....."  (No!  This wasn't supposed to happen!! 
Everything was fine until Ryoko showed up!  She may know something...and 
does she have to soil Tenchi's lips RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME!!!)
	"So how do you play "SORRY"?"
	"Well..." he began to explain, and when he was done, they started.  
Everything was going fine until Ayeka was starting to win, and Ryoko got 
jealous, when Tenchi congratulated her on her success so far.  But when 
Ryoko got a "SORRY" card she totally bumped Ayeka out of the ring.
	"HA!  Take that!"
	"What is your problem, devil woman! Can't handle losing!?!"
	"You should watch what your saying, Miss Prissy Pants!"
	"Is that a challenge!?!?!"
	"I'll say!  Let's settle your little jealously problem, right 
now!"
	"Hey! hey! what's going on!?!  I went to get a drink and world war 
3 starts!?!?!?"
	"Oh Tenchi, that crazy woman, started yelling at me and 
threatening me, because I was winning! *sob*"
	"Ryoko?!?!  What are you doing?!?!"
	"Tenchi! You can't believe what she is saying!?!?! She's totally 
lying to you!!  She's manipulating you!!"
	"Listen to her Tenchi!  She's going insane!"
	"Ryoko, I think you need to cool off, maybe playing a game wasn't 
the right thing now.."
	"Oh..my!!!"  She stormed off and started screaming in her head.  ( 
AHHHHHHHHH! I CAN'T STAND THAT GIRL!!!  SHE IS COMPLETELY RUINING 
EVERYTHING!!!!  WHY!?!?!?!!?!)  She screamed so hard, that Tenchi could 
feel everything.
	(What the ????)
	"Ayeka.. I'll be right back.."
	"Tenchi, please don't leave me alone!!!"
	"I'll be right back!"  He ran off to find Ryoko.  He spotted her 
starting to fly off in the distance, yelling and beating herself.  
	"Ryoko!  What is going on!"
	"SHE IS WHAT IS GOING ON!!!  Can't you see?!?!  Ever since me and 
you got together, she's been trying even harder to get your attention,  
yes I may be jealous, yes I may be mad at you, but I am not lying about 
her!!! She is totally manipulating you, and you don't even notice it!!!!  
She made you stay home so you wouldn't spend time with me!  Check her 
arms!  I bet she doesn't have one bruise on her body!  How could she 
fall down stairs and not be damaged one bit!!!  I am not going to stay 
here if she is fawning over you like...like...some hopeless 
....thing!!!"
	"Ryoko...I don't know what to think...but I do know that you 
should stay outside for a bit..."  He left her confused and tormented.  
(Ayeka couldn't manipulate me...that's just not her...)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
INSIDE~~
	(this is the perfect moment!  Now that Ryoko is out of the 
picture, i can make my move...Here goes nothing.....)
	"Ayeka..I am so sorry about that!!  I don't know what happened 
and...."
	"Don't worry about her Tenchi...you have me..."  She said in a 
seductive voice, as she moved in on him.
	"Uh...ya Ayeka.....are you ok...?"
	"Oh, Tenchi. I am doing fine, but I am a little afraid..."  she 
continued to corner him to the wall.
	"Oh...ya...? about what?" he replied a little nervously.
	"That she will interrupt our....love..." She closed in on him and 
grabbed him, kissing him ferociously and passionately.  He tried to pull 
away, but she held on to him, not letting him go.  She pushed him onto 
the table and climbed on top of him.
	"Ayeka....what's....hmph!!"  She shut him up by kissing him again, 
forcing the air out his body.
	"Tenchi, you need me, and I need you!"  She continued to kiss him, 
over and over.  He got his hands loose and grabbed her shoulders.
	"Ayeka, you must hit your head...you're not yourself right 
now...maybe you should lie down and go to sleep."
	"What are you talking about Tenchi?  I feel fine...*sob*  Maybe 
you're right...*sob*  I'm not a pretty girl!!!"
	"Huh!?!"  She threw herself into his arms, clutching his chest, 
and cried in his arms.
	"I don't deserve you!  I'm a horrible person.  You were right!"
	"What are you talking about Ayeka?"  She continued to cry in his 
shirt
	"Tenchi, I don't think I can stand....any..." she slumped to the 
ground.
	"Ayeka!! *sigh*"  He picked her up and carried her to her bed, set 
her down and walked out of the room.  ( What am I going to do?!?!  This 
is now like a huge soap opera!?!?!)  He looked out of the window and saw 
Ryoko hovering above the lake skipping stones.  He suddenly remembered 
the time when he slapped Ryoko and told her he hated her.  (What am I 
doing?!?!)  He looked back out of the window and she disappeared.  He 
didn't see her the rest of night.  He looked outside, at the shrine, the 
cave, the roof and the cherry blossom trees, she was no where. (She 
should show up in the morning.)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	"Good morning Tenchi, I'm glad to see you got some sleep?"
	"Uh ya, Sasami."  He looked at the table and saw Ayeka, cheery and 
happy, and then Ryoko, looking down at her plate, which was still full 
as if it wasn't touched, she had circles under her eyes, and no 
expression on her face.  She then pushed the plate away and murmured 
some excuse to leave.
	"Oh, ok, some one will probably eat your food Ryoko."  Tenchi 
watched Ryoko as she walked upstairs and went to her room.
	"Hey Sasami, could you give me her plate?"
	"Sure Tenchi!"  Sasami gave Tenchi Ryoko's plate and Tenchi went 
upstairs to Ryoko's door.  He could hear loud, rock music coming from 
inside her room and tried knocking loudly on the door.
	"RYOKO?!?!"  He got no answer so he opened the door.  When he 
stepped inside he didn't see anyone, so he stepped through and set her 
food down.
	"Ryoko?"  He noticed her sitting on the floor and the other side 
of the bed, looking at photographs of her and Tenchi, which had huge 
drops of water on them.  He turned down her music.
	"Tenchi...You were right..I was being stupid and judged Ayeka 
before I talked to her...I'm...sorry"
	"Ryoko, don't worry about it..We haven't had a peaceful day 
together in a while, you were just stressing it."
	"Well, when I saw her laying on you..and looking so happy with 
you...I...i got jealous."
	"You...saw her on me..."
	"She was laughing and having a good time.. I just wanted to be 
her..."
	(Oh good she didn't see Ayeka kiss me after she left...)
	"Hey, I know how about we do something today.."
	"Like what?"
	"Well, I don't know..you pick."
	"Hurray!  Let's go...to the movies!"
	"Ok! Let me get a shower and get changed, and we'll go to the 
movies!" Tenchi left her room to get ready and Ryoko leapt for joy. 
(Ayeka...you may have got Tenchi's attention last night, but he's with 
me and he's staying with me!)  Ryoko shut her door, and tried to think 
of the best outfit to wear with Tenchi.  (I want it to be sexy...but not 
to revealing...hmmmm...)  While Tenchi was getting ready...
	(What should we see....something not romantic...or not too 
scary....)  He got his clothes and went off to the shower.  Little did 
he know that Ayeka was watching him from the shadows when he from when 
he left Ryoko's room. She crept toward Ryoko's room and smiled when she 
heard the music get louder again.  Then she put her ear to the door of 
the shower and listen for water.  When the shower came on, she mentally 
prepared herself.  She put her hand on the knob and slowly turned it, to 
make sure know one could hear it.  When the door was unlocked she slowly 
opened the door, she stopped when she could see the shower. The curtain 
was closed, and she could see Tenchi's silhouette behind it.  Right 
before she opened the rest of the door, she heard Ryoko's door creak.  
She shut the door and ran off to her room.  Ryoko opened the door in 
time to see Ayeka shut her door.  (hm...o well....) She knocked on the 
door and told Tenchi to hurry up.  The shower stopped and Tenchi came 
out.  When he saw her he just smiled.  She was wearing jeans fraying at 
the ends, and a red tank top.  Her hair was the usual spike.  
	"You ready?!?!"
	"Ya let's go."  So they told Sasami they were going to the movies 
and left.
	"So what movie should we see?"
	"Hmm....I was thinking...a comedy.  Do you what's out?"
	"Not really, we should check..."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Back at the house....
	(Ugh!!! I almost did it!  He left too soon!!..I have to think of 
something else!  Now that Ryoko made up with Tenchi...he's not mad at 
her....what should I do!!!  Oh curse the day I ever met him...no....the 
day he met her!  I must get Tenchi to get rid of Ryoko...then he would 
be with me!!!  A LETTER!?!?!  Of course!)  She then left to start her 
next plan..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Later that night....
	"Then the man jumped on the trampoline and started to chase the 
burgler....Hahaha!!"
	"Hehehe...wow Ryoko you guys saw a funny movie!  I wish I could go 
to the movies..."
	"Hey Sasami, just ask me any day and I'll take ya to see a good 
one!"
	"Wow! Really? Thanks!"
	"No problem..hey where's Ayeka??"
	"Oh, she said she had to run some errands earlier and said she 
would be home for dinner."
	"O..ok.."  Ryoko whispered in his ear
	(Now you can spend some time with me!)  She winked at him and 
walked outside to the porch and curled her fingers for him to follow.
	"Uh..I'll..I'll talk to you later..uh sasami..." he leaves with a 
look of happiness and nervousness at the same time.
	"Now we can have that walk you promised me before that game..."  
Tenchi noticed how her voice cracked at the mention of the game "Sorry" 
they played when he yelled at her.
	"Ryoko..I didn't mean anything by telling you to calm 
down..I..was..well..I was just thinking that I didn't want to see any 
one hurt so I thought you should have calmed down.  UH..um..If..if Ayeka 
was in the same mood I would have said the same thing."
	"Tenchi..I know you didn't mean anything..but..but I can't stand 
to see her get in betweeen us..I just....mphh.."  Her sentence was cut 
off by the force of Tenchi's kiss that he planted on her mouth.  Instead 
of struggling away she fell into the kiss and weakly gave in.
	"Shh..no more talk of Ayeka..I still owe you that walk."  So they 
went off into the woods to relax.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	"Sasami!  Sasami!"
	"Oh hello there sister..did you find everything you were looking 
for?"
	"Why yes Sasami...where is Tenchi at?"
	"Oh he went on a walk with Ryoko a few minutes ago..I'm getting 
dinner ready now..would you like to help me?"
	"Not right now Sasami..I have something to do..but please call me 
when dinners ready..."	
	"Of course sister.."
	"..oh and..if Tenchi comes back before dinner..tell him I would 
like to talk to him when he gets back.."  (Hopefully he would have read 
the letter I put in his jacket by now...)
	"*sigh* alright Ayeka."  Ayeka then skipped up the stairs with 
mischieve and a slight pinch of happiness, while humming to herself.
	(La la la la..oh what a day what a day...my my Tenchi you have no 
idea what is in store for you tonight...hahahaha!)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	*sigh* "Tenchi?"
	"hmm?"
	"Do you ever think we'll be able to travel space?"
	"Of course Ryoko..why do you ask?"
	"Well I mean with Ayeka and Sasami around, I would feel wierd by 
just leaving them behind."
	"Yes, I do see your point..but do not worry..one day Ryoko, you 
and me will travel the stars."
	"*sigh*"
	"Ryoko?"
	"ya?"
	"Is something bothering you?"
	"Well I can't help but worry that something is coming between 
us.."
	"What do you mean?"
	"Well..we're seeing each other less..You're with Ayeka most of 
time now..I can't help but feel like you are drifting away..."
	"Ryoko..I would never drift away from you..don't even think of 
that..and I am only with Ayeka because of her accident..and besides I 
think she is over with it.."
	"The accident..right.."
	"Hey, you still have some time to spend with me today..remember I 
said today was your day!?!?"
	"Oh yes!!"
	"Well..what would you like to do?!?"
	"You still owe me dinner!!"
	"Alright dinner it is!  Mihoshi and Kiyone are visiting today..so 
Ayeka and Sasami should have company for dinner..I just hope she wasn't 
planning anyhting big tonight...you know what..you get ready and I am 
going to make reservaitons for someplace "special"..it's a surprise!"
	"A surprise!?!?!  Oooo Tenchi you know I don't like surprises when 
I am expecting them..I get so paranoid!!"
	"Hahaha..be patient and go ready..*sigh*  you're too cute Ryoko"
	"Yes I know..hehe..don't be long with the reservations now!!  I 
can't wait!"
	(Now..where to go...)  He looked and Ryoko one last time before 
she phased out to her room.  (Oh yes!  I must tell Sasami about my 
dinner plans!)
	"Sasami! Sasami!  There you are."
	"OH hi Tenchi!  Dinner is almost ready!"
	"Yes..about dinner.."
	"Uh oh..you can't make dinner can you..."
	"Well it's not that..see Ryoko and I havn't gotten to see each 
other in quite some time now ....with everything thats going on..and I 
told her today was her day to spend with me..so I'm taking to her to 
dinner..it's alright with you that we miss dinner..?"
	"Of course Tenchi..it makes me happy to see you bring joy in 
Ryoko's life..I just wish my sister saw it that way.."
	"Yes...well..I have to make reservations now..thank you so much 
Sasami for understanding..I'll make it up to you big time!!!"  Sasami 
smiled at the thought and went back to preparing dinner.
	(Oh no! I forgot to tell Tenchi about Ayeka...oh well..i'll tell 
her I didn't see him until to late..I wonder what it is about..?)  With 
curiosity in mind she crept off to Ayeka's room where she saw her sister 
looking through her window and saying something to herself.   She peered 
in to get a look and listen better...
	"Oh Tenchi, once you read that letter...and you will have to 
believe it of course..I'll get rid of her and Tenchi I'll tell you she 
left for the stars like she always talked about..she could not stand 
being around when she knew I was meant for Tenchi..oh yes this is 
good!!!  Oh my..I have to get Ryoko fast!!!"
	(Oh my!!  What is Ayeka doing!?!?!)
	"Tenchi will be all mine..and once Tenchi falls for me and forgets 
about Ryoko..I'll dispose of her!"
	(No!!!  I must..wait!  Ryoko and Tenchi are going to dinner!  
Thank goodness! But I must watch my sister close to protect Ryoko. Oh 
my..she is getting wierd..)  As Sasami was thinking by Ayekas door, she 
could her Ayeka's footsteps getting closer to the door.   Sasami quickly 
fled the scene and ran down the stairs to work on dinner and hide from 
Ayeka.
	"Oh Sasami!"
	"Yes..Ayeka?"
	"When will dinner be ready?"
	"Uh..um..In ten minutes."
	"Alright..thanx!"

~~~~~~~~~~
	"Hm....Now what to wear..we are going to the nicest resteraunt in 
Tokyo..so I'll wear my tux from that dance I went to a while back.."  He 
looked in his closet for his tuxedo when he knocked over jacket and a 
piece of folded paper fell out of the pocket.
	"Huh? What's this...?" He began to read the letter...

Tenchi, 
I am writing to you to let you know, that I have left...I can not stand 
living in this place when I understand that you and me were not meant to 
be together..Ayeka is who you belong with...I have seen it in your 
eyes..and in hers..i am a foolish thing to believe it was me...please 
understand...
Always....Ryoko
	"What!?!?!?! No this can't be right..she was right with me just 
seconds ago...Ryoko! RYOKO!!!!"  He ran out of the room desperatly..and 
down the stairs screaming her name.
	"Ryoko, where are you!?!?!"  Ayeka heard his cries and smiled.  
She ran to him with a look of worry on her face.
	"Tenchi!  What is it!?!?!"
	"Ayeka!  Did you see Ryoko?"
	"Oh my! Yes!  She was frantic..she just screamed and left on Ryo-
Ohki.  I tried to stop her but she was crazy...oh Tenchi!"  She fell 
onto him and started to cry.
	"No....no...it's all a lie...she couldn't of 
left...not....Ryoko...."  He fell to the ground on his knees and stared 
at the ground.  Ayeka fell off of him when he hit the ground.   Then 
Sasami came running out of the house.
	"Tenchi!?!?!  What happened?!?!"  He didn't move his eyes off the 
ground when he answered quietly.
	"She's...gone..she left..."
	"What!?!  No! Oh my.." She started to cry also.  After minutes of 
crying Ssasami managed to get up and solemnly walk into the house.  
Ayeka looked at Tenchi and "sighed" then left for the house also.  
Tenchi just sat,  staring at the ground. Inside the house the dinner was 
starting.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~
	"Sasami?"
	"Yes, Mr. Masaki?" She sniffled.
	"Where are Tenchi and Ryoko?"  She looked at him with tears in her 
eyes, and then ran up stairs crying.
	"What happened?"
	"Mr. Masaki..Ryoko..ryoko has...she has left.." Shock, fear, and 
pain hit everyone at the table.  Washu looked up in shock then ran off 
crying to her lab.
	"oh..oh my..why?"
	"I don't know..she decided that she was not meant to live 
here..she did not belong"
	"Ryoko..left?"
	"Yes..."
	"Mihoshi...please don't start cry...."  She was cut off by 
Mihoshi's wailing.
	"This is a very...emotional meal.  Um..Where is Tenchi?"
	"*sniff* Out side..." Katsuhitsu got up from the table and left 
with some food outside.  Out there he saw Tenchi, sitting...staring at 
the ground.  Katsuhitsu sat next to him, looking at the stars.
	"They are beautiful, arn't they"  Tenchi did not reply nor did he 
look up.
	"A butterfly may be able to beat it's wings every second to 
live..but will never be happy enough ."  Tenchi looked at his 
grandfather.
	"Grandfather?"
	"Tenchi, life has it's twists and turns in every way..Ryoko is 
like the butterfly.  She was able to be here on earth..peaceful and 
safe...but it's not what she wanted.  She can't live in the passive 
form..her life depends on excitement."
	"But..granfather..I..i love her..and she's gone..." Tenchi and his 
grandfather sat in silence for the rest of the night.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~     
	Inside the house, Kiyone, Ayeka and Nobiyuki were silently eating.  
Sasami was in her room crying to herself.
	"Why Ayeka!?!?!  *sniff* Ryoko never did anything bad to you!  I 
know Ryoko didn't leave..but I don't know where she IS!  *sniff* I have 
to find her and tell Tenchi..but not until I DO find her.."  She began 
to think of  possible places.  A knock came at her door then.
	"Sasami? Sasami?" Sasami dried her eyes and opened her door.  
	"O..oh..Ayeka..*sniff* hello.."
	"Oh Sasami are you ok!?!  I am so sorry Ryoko left.  I miss her so 
much already!  If only we could find her.  Poor Tenchi is so 
heartbroken..how dare she leave Tenchi like this..I should go cheer him 
up."  Then she suddenly left.  Sasami thought to herself, (That was 
kinda odd..)  
	"Tenchi must still be outside..Ah..there he is!"  She quietly sat 
down next to Tenchi.
	"Why Ayeka..."
	"HUH!?!?!"
	"Why would Ryoko leave...?"
	"Oh..(phew)..Tenchi..please do not worry about Ryoko..she believed 
that she did not belong here..."
	"She left me this letter..in my pocket.."  He gave Ayeka the 
letter.
	"Oh..my..."
	"I still don't understand.." Ayeka looked at him then got closer 
and hugged him.  "Thanx.."
	"Tenchi..you must listen..what ever her reasons were..it won't 
bring her back.."
	"*sigh* I know..."
	"Come with me inside..please Tenchi?" He sat for a couple of 
minutes thinking it over.
	"In a few minutes, I will be inside.."
	"Ok!" She smiled and happily skipped to the house. Tenchi was too 
busy thinking to notice her happy skipping.
	(Tenchi is mine...tenchi is mine...oh happy day!  Yes I know I 
made everyone else sad..but...Tenchi is mine!!  Now to think of how to 
dispose of Ryoko...)  While Ayeka was thinking about Ryoko's doom, 
Tenchi got up and solemnly walked into the house.  He didn't speak a 
word a word to anyone, just walked up the stairs to his room.  Then, 
while checking if anyone was around, Sasami quietly crept outside to 
begin her search.
	(Where would Ayeka hide Ryoko?)  She grabbed a flashlight and 
started heading off to various places.  She starting in the shed, there 
were tools and carrots..but no Ryoko.  She looked near the shrine, far 
into the woods, and near the lake..but no Ryoko.  It started to get 
REALLY dark..so she went inside almost hopeless. (I'll never be able to 
find her!  But I must before Ayeka gets rid of her!)  She quickly ran 
inside to make sure Ayeka didn't leave.  Thankfully Ayeka was still on 
the couch thinking and didn't even notice Sasami's presence or that she 
was ever gone.  She said a quick goodnight to everyone and prepared 
herself for an early start in the morning.  As she walked by Tenchi's 
door she could hear Tenchi talking...but to whom?!?!  She opened his 
door and saw he was asleep..and talking.  He was murmering Ryoko's name 
and crying out to her.  She sighed and continued to her room.  (Don't 
worry Tenchi..I'll find her!)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~
	*YAWN* "Oh my..I have to start searching!!"  Sasami quickly got 
dressed, and went downstairs to start a very early breakfast..just 
incase she was gone too long.  She ran upstairs to get her shoes when 
she heard Tenchi talking again.  Again, she opened his door and crept 
in.  He was turning in his sleep and sweating a lot.  She got closer to 
hear him, when he jolted up in his bed with wide eyes.
	"AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!"
	"Sasami!  Sasami..she's here! She's here!  I..I can feel her 
presence!"  His face lit up, and a smile appeared on his face.  New hope 
arose within Sasami, when she heard him speak.
	"Well get up and get dressed...we have to find her quick!"  He 
jumped out of bed and got dressed.
	"I know where she is!!"  They ran out of the house and straight 
for her cave.
	"There!"  They ran inside only to find Ayeka dragging Ryoko, bound 
and gagged, over to a corner in the cave.  In the corner there were 
knives from the kitchen and a fire.
	"Stop struggling, you demon!"
	"Ayeka!"  Ayeka jumped in fright, turned around, and saw Tenchi 
ferious.
	"Ayeka..what are you doing!?!?!"
	"Tenchi...I..I..found her...here..."
	"Stop lying Ayeka!  I heard you talking..you kidnapped Ryoko to 
force Tenchi into loving you...you were..going to ...kill her..."
	"No!! No, thats not true..."
	"Then was the whole "accident" a lie to!?!?!  Ryoko was telling me 
all along..but i ignored it...YOU TRICKED ME!!! JUST SO I WOULD HATE 
HER!!!"  He became so angry that he ran towards her with all his 
strength, screaming.
	"Tenchi no!!!!!!!"  He stopped just in time so see Sasami crying 
in fright.
	"Tenchi...no...please don't hurt Ayeka...please..she's still my 
sister..."  He looked at Ayeka with disgust and walked past her, to 
Ryoko, then untied her.  Ryoko fell to the ground panting.
	"Ha!  Ayeka..I told you, you could win Tenchi over...because you 
would only force him..."  She looked at Ayeka with rage, then at Tenchi 
lovingly and with thanks.  Ayeka just stood looking at the ground in 
shock.  Sasami looked at Ryoko hugging Tenchi with a smile, then at 
Ayeka with sadness.  She left the cave and slowly walked to house.
	"Sasami! Sasami wait up!"
	"Huh!?"
	"Sasami..thank you for helping me..you will never know how much 
this means to me!"
	"It was nothing Ryoko...but you do know what it DOES mean... You 
owe me dinner!"
	"HAHAHAHA!  Ok!"  They walked toward the house together; Ryoko, 
Tenchi, and Sasami.
When they got inside everyone was still asleep..so Sasami continued with 
breakfast, and Ryoko and Tenchi went upstairs to Tenchi's room.  When 
Ryoko stepped inside the room, Tenchi glomped her.
	"Ryoko, I am so sorry for not believing you!  If I just listened 
this wouildn't have happened! I can't believe..."  He was cut off by 
Ryoko's lips.  She kissed him lovingly, and with passion.
	"Tenchi...do not worry..it's ok.."  They continued to kiss as if 
they would never be together again.  But no matter what would happen..no 
matter who came into the house..nothing kept them apart.....
