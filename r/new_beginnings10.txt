"Mihoshi to the Rescue"

TEASER

FADE IN:

EXT. Space - Day (Monday, 1 June 1998, First Day; 4th Month)

Nothing but stars.

KAZUHIKO (O.C.)
Mihoshi?  Mihoshi!

MIHOSHI (O.C.)
Yes Kazuhiko.

KAZUHIKO (O.C.)
Thank God you're here.

MIHOSHI (O.C.)
I'm right beside you.

KAZUHIKO (O.C.)
Where is here?

MIHOSHI (O.C.)
We're on Yukinojo in ultra drive heading for the SAR system.

KAZUHIKO (O.C.)
Oh.  All I can see is...  Well it's like those fractal patterns they
showed us in math class.

MIHOSHI (O.C.)
That's interesting.  I like to call it chaos.

KAZUHIKO (O.C.)
Chaos.  That's a better name to describe it.  It's so beautiful.

MIHOSHI (O.C.)
I don't come here very often.  It's hard on Yukinojo to go this fast.

KAZUHIKO (O.C.)
When will we get there?

MIHOSHI (O.C.)
We'll come out of ultra drive in about three and a half hours.  Then it
will take seven more days to get to the SAR system.

KAZUHIKO (O.C.)
I guess I'll enjoy the ride while we wait.  I can't touch you here can I?

MIHOSHI (O.C.)
Do you want to Kazuhiko?

KAZUHIKO (O.C.)
I'd like to hold your hand while we wait.

MIHOSHI (O.C.)
Just reach out to me.

KAZUHIKO (O.C.)
I think I can feel...  Yes, it's your hand.  I could stay here forever.

Mihoshi giggles.

MIHOSHI (O.C.)
Forever is a long time, and Kiyone does need our help.

KAZUHIKO (O.C.)
Of course she does.  Thank you for bringing me here.

MIHOSHI (O.C.)
You're welcome Kazuhiko.

INT. Sasami's room - DAY

Sasami stands in the room.

SASAMI (expressed as thought)
Tsunami I need you now.

Tsunami appears in the room looking like the adult Sasami.

SASAMI
What's your true form Tsunami?

TSUNAMI
I do not have a true form.  I can assume any shape to interact with
those in the mortal realm.

SASAMI
I don't wish you to look like me any more.

TSUNAMI
I am sorry Sasami.  It's just that I...

SASAMI (overlapping)
I know what you were thinking then.  I wish I didn't, but that doesn't
change anything.

TSUNAMI
Can you understand what troubles me?

Sasami nods her head.

SASAMI
Little Washu.  You must love her very much to go to this length not to
hurt her.

TSUNAMI
She is the daughter I can never have.

SASAMI
Why?  Washu has a daughter.  You should be able to also.

TSUNAMI
Washu may liver forever but she is mortal now.  She can die.  Even
I don't know all the details that went into creating her daughter.

SASAMI
What about her son?

TSUNAMI
Washu manipulated her husband's genes.  He never had another child
during the remaining two thousand years of life.  He died regretting
what he did to Washu, and I pity the man.

SASAMI
We must live with our choices.  You have no other choice but to live
with yours.

Tsunami changes here appearance.  Her hair turns brown and is in the
Jurai style.  Her eyes remain pink while her face resembles Ayeka's.
Her body is a close match to Ryoko.

TSUNAMI
How does this look?

SASAMI
Better.  I'm surprised you choose Ryoko's body over Mihoshi's.  Will you
stay like this for awhile?

TSUNAMI
Yes Sasami, and I did not want to flaunt my looks too much.  I just
do not know what to do about my feelings.

SASAMI
Come with me to lunch today.  We will see what happens after that.

Tsunami nods her head.

TSUNAMI
This will not be easy.

SASAMI
It never is.

INT. Washu's lab - DAY

Washu sits on her pillow in front of her keyboard.

WASHU
Hmm, well I'll have to wait for lunch then.

FADE OUT

END TEASER.



ACT ONE

FADE IN:

INT. Dining Room - DAY

Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko, and Ryo-Ohki sit at the table.

Sasami and another girl walk in.

The new girl has long brown hair styled in the Jurai fashion.  She has
pink eyes like Sasami's and her face is similar to Ayeka's.  Her body
is a lot like Ryoko's.

Everyone at the table looks at the new comer.

TENCHI
Who's your friend, Sasami?

NEW GIRL
Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko, please forgive me.

Ayeka covers her mouth and her eyes go wide.

AYEKA
Tsunami!

Tenchi stands and walks around the table to Tsunami.

Ayeka and Ryoko follow Tenchi with their eyes.

He hugs Tsunami.

TENCHI
I've already forgiven you Tsunami.  I don't understand what happened,
but Sasami does and that is good enough for me.

TSUNAMI
Thank you Tenchi.

Tenchi returns to his seat.

AYEKA
Well it's not good...

Tenchi squeezes her shoulder.

TENCHI
Please Ayeka, let's drop it.

Ayeka looks questioningly at Tenchi.

RYOKO
So Tsunami, now you know how I feel.  I don't know how many times Tenchi
kicked me out when I tried to get him in the sack.

TENCHI and AYEKA
Ryoko!

RYOKO
Well it's true.

TENCHI
Please join us for lunch Tsunami

TSUNAMI
Thank you.

Tsunami sits down.

TSUNAMI
I am really sorry for what happened.  Do you have any idea what eternity
is like?

RYOKO
I have a small idea.  It can be very lonely.

Tsunami nods her head.

RYOKO
I like your new body Tsunami.  It's very becoming.

Ayeka takes in a deep breath.

AYEKA
Ryoko please take Tenchi and leave right now.

Tenchi and Ryoko look at Ayeka

TENCHI
What are you planning Ayeka?

AYEKA
Please Ryoko!

Ryoko nods her head and stands bringing Tenchi up with her.

TENCHI
Just hold on a minute.  I want to know what you're doing...

RYOKO (overlapping)
Tenchi!  Did we question you when you told us to go to bed after what
we saw?

TENCHI
But I just want...

RYOKO (overlapping)
No Tenchi.  What ever is going to happen will happen.  Can't you trust
your wife?

Tenchi's face looks lost.

AYEKA
Please!

Tenchi sighs.

Ryoko and Tenchi disappear.

Sasami stands.

AYEKA
Sit down Sasami.  Anything we discuss will get to you sooner or later,
so you might as well get it first hand.

Sasami sits back down.

RYO-OHKI
Miya?

AYEKA
Ryo-Ohki, would you please leave us alone?

Ryo-Ohki stands up.

RYO-OHKI
Miya?

Sasami nods her head.

Ryo-Ohki walks over to Ayeka and pats her on the cheek.

RYO-OHKI
Miiyaa?

Ryo-Ohki leaves the room.

TSUNAMI
I am sorry Ayeka.  I...

AYEKA (overlapping)
Please Tsunami.  This isn't going to be easy for me.  I want to tell you
a story from when I was a little girl.

Tsunami shakes her head.

TSUNAMI
Ayeka you do not have...

AYEKA (overlapping)
Yes, I do.

TSUNAMI
Just wait one moment.

Tsunami closes her eyes and a look of concentration washes over her face.

TSUNAMI
There, it is done.

Ayeka composes herself while the other two look on.

AYEKA
>From the time I was born my father told me I would marry Yoshou.
I always looked forward to that day.  I had complete freedom to roam
around the palace.  Do you remember what it was like Sasami?

SASAMI
Yes sister.

AYEKA
When I was six I found a secret door that led to a secret world.  It was
my world and it was where I could dream.  From this world I could look
at all others and they didn't know I was there.Tsunami shakes her head.

AYEKA
I would watch father and mommy when they were alone, and I would dream.
I would watch father and auntie alone, and I would dream.  I would watch
mommy and auntie alone and wonder if I would ever find such love.  Most
of all I would watch Yoshou when he was alone.  I would dream of the day
he would be my husband and he could hold me like father held his wives.

SASAMI
Please Ayeka.

Ayeka looks at Sasami and smiles.

AYEKA
One day Yoshou brought another woman in his room.  She was a beautiful
lady.  Her hair was the color of mine, and her eyes were the color of
mine.  I would dream that I would grow up to be beautiful like her and
that Yoshou would hold and kiss me like he did her.

TSUNAMI
Please Ayeka

AYEKA
Then Ryoko came, and Yoshou left me.  I was so sad that he left without
me.  So I went to find the lady because I thought she would also be sad
that Yoshou left.  I hoped we could share our loneliness together like
mommy and auntie.  Only I couldn't find her no matter how much
I searched.

Ayeka pauses and drinks some tea while staring at Tsunami.

AYEKA
I thought that Yoshou took the lady with him when he departed Jurai.
My love turned to hatred.  I couldn't believe that he abandoned me for
some other woman when we were destined to be married.  My life filled
with hatred, and I grew up to be the bitter, angry bitch that you see
today.

SASAMI
That's not true Ayeka.

Ayeka tosses her head.

AYEKA
Then we came here, and here was Ryoko.  The one who stole my future
husband from me.  Here was Tenchi, a descendent of Yoshou.  I thought
that if I couldn't have Yoshou I could settle for his offspring.

Tsunami bows her head in her hands and begins to cry.

AYEKA
Then I find out Yoshou is alive and my hatred grew.  I thought that
Itsuki was that evil woman that Yoshou took with him from Jurai.  Only
now it is so clear to me.  That vile woman couldn't leave Jurai until
Sasami left.  Why Tsunami?  Why did you destroy my life?

TSUNAMI
I never meant for him to leave Ayeka.  I thought we could share him.
I am so sorry to have hurt you.

AYEKA
Hurt me can not begin to describe what you have done.  I hate everyone,
and most of all I hate myself.

Ayeka breaks down in tears.

Sasami walks over to comfort Ayeka.

AYEKA
I hate you too Sasami.  You're so damn bright and cheerful.

SASAMI
I love you sister.

Ayeka shakes her head.

AYEKA
Damn you!  Why can't you hate me?  Why does everyone say they love me
when I'm such an evil woman?  I'm worse than that monster woman!

SASAMI
Please sister.  You have to let go.

AYEKA
Only death will separate me from this pain.

Sasami helps Ayeka to stand.

Ayeka leans her weight on Sasami.

Sasami leads her from the room like a child.

SASAMI (O.C.)
Do you know where Tenchi is?

WASHU (O.C.)
He and Ryoko are in the cave.

Tsunami lifts her head in shock.

SASAMI (O.C.)
Thank you Little Washu.

Washu enters the dining room.

She sits next to Tsunami.

Washu pours tea for both of them.

TSUNAMI
I have really messed things up this time.

Tsunami looks at Washu

Washu drinks her tea.

TSUNAMI
I did not know that Ayeka had seen any of that.  I am so sorry Washu.

WASHU
I can count the number of times I have been happy on one hand.  When
my husband purposed to me.  When my son was born.  When Ryoko called
me mom from her heart, and now with Yoshou.

TSUNAMI
I never meant to hurt anyone.

WASHU
April roses, tiny sparrows, cornets bright and new.

TSUNAMI
You remember.

WASHU
That song was always in my mind.  I had forgotten most of it, but Sasami
has taught the rest to me.  I don't think I could share a man with my
mother, but with my foster mother I could share anything.

Tsunami hugs Washu

TSUNAMI
You look now like you did then, when you announced that you were leaving
to conquer the universe.

WASHU
Thank you for letting me go.

Washu stands and walks behind Tsunami.

Washu lays a hand on Tsunami's shoulder.


WASHU
He's alone now at the temple.  I'm going
to my lab if you should need me.

Washu walks on but stops in the doorway.

WASHU
I've turned off all of my monitoring
devices.  I'll leave them off.  I don't
think there is anything further for me to
gain with them.

Washu walks out of the room.

Tsunami sighs and then she disappears.

INT. Cave - DAY

Tenchi and Ryoko sit in the inner most part of the cave next to Ryoko's
pit.

TENCHI
Why did we come here?

RYOKO
I come here quite often when I need to think.  I used to hate this place,
but now I can enjoy the solitude when I know I can leave at any time.

TENCHI
This is where we first touched.

RYOKO
I nearly scared you to death.  I wanted you so much.  It had been ten
years since the last time you came to the cave.

TENCHI
Life moved on and...

Ryoko lays a hand against Tenchi's mouth.

RYOKO
No need to explain.  I understand.  Yoshou planned well for my release.
He told me the day you left, right after you said good bye to me, that
you would return to release me.

TENCHI
I'm worried about Ayeka.

RYOKO
She is full of loneliness.  I hope that by confronting Tsunami she may
be able to leave her past behind her.

TENCHI
What do you mean?

RYOKO
We talk at night, and she often talks in her sleep.  She's so vulnerable
and that is part of why I love her.

TENCHI
In the past you two fought so much that it made me cry at night.  I've
always cared for both of you.  I care for everyone in the house.

RYOKO
I know.  I've always known that I couldn't have you to my self.  It was
hard to accept.  When Ayeka came to me with the compromise to share you
I was so surprised, and so happy.

TENCHI
Ayeka came to you?

RYOKO
It was her last hope to find love in her life.

SASAMI (O.C.)
Hello?

TENCHI
We're in here Sasami.

SASAMI (O.C.)
I need your help.

Ryoko takes Tenchi's hand and they disappear.

INT. Cave shrine room - DAY

Sasami and Ayeka sit near the split rock at the inner entrance.

Ayeka is sobbing.

Ryoko and Tenchi appear in the room.

Tenchi immediately moves to Ayeka.

He picks Ayeka up in his arms and kisses her.

AYEKA
Damn you Tenchi.  Why must you care for me?  Is it only because I carry
your child?

TENCHI
Ayeka, words can not tell you how I feel.

Tenchi holds her close.

Ryoko wraps her arms around Tenchi and Sasami.

All four disappear.

INT. Grandfather's study - DAY

Grandfather sits at the table.

He is writing out charms for temple visitors.

Tsunami appears behind him.

GRANDFATHER
You've caused quite a commotion Tsunami.

TSUNAMI
I have feelings too, Yoshou.

GRANDFATHER
Everyone does.  That's why there's pain in the universe.

TSUNAMI
And joy and happiness.

GRANDFATHER
True.

TSUNAMI
I love you Yoshou.

GRANDFATHER
My love for you is what holds me back.

TSUNAMI
Little Washu knows everything.

Grandfather suddenly looks up.

He turns to face Tsunami.

TSUNAMI
Ayeka knows everything too.

Grandfather bows and covers his face with his hands.

GRANDFATHER
How?

Tears come to Tsunami's eyes.

TSUNAMI
She always knew from the first day we met.  Only now she knows whom that
woman was that you brought to your room.

GRANDFATHER
How?

TSUNAMI
She found some secret ways in the palace that would let her spy on people
unnoticed.

Grandfather looks up at Tsunami with a lost look on his face.

TSUNAMI
Why did you leave, or more, why did you never come back.

GRANDFATHER
I couldn't marry Ayeka after having been with you.  I couldn't face her.
It was end it all or leave.  Ryoko gave me a way out with honor.

TSUNAMI
And where is your honor now?

GRANDFATHER
It's with Tenchi.

Tsunami touches Grandfather's cheek.

TSUNAMI
I do not care what you look like.  I will still love you.

GRANDFATHER
I can't.  Little Washu means...

Grandfather falters and looks down at his hands.

TSUNAMI
So you have finally found one that could replace me.

GRANDFATHER
Replace you, no, but stand beside you, yes.

TSUNAMI
I raised Washu as a child.  She came to me shortly after she was born
and stayed with me for all of ten years.

Grandfather's face is filled with questions.

TSUNAMI
I love Washu as the daughter I can never have.  She loves me as the
mother she can not find.  We both love you Yoshou.  Can you accept that?

GRANDFATHER
And Ayeka?

TSUNAMI
That is for her to decide.  She has Tenchi, Ryoko, and Sasami to help
her through this if she will accept their help.

GRANDFATHER
That's the real question.  Can a life that's been a living hell be
turned around?

TSUNAMI
What is it you say?  Anything is possible if you believe in it hard
enough.

GRANDFATHER
Would you like some tea?

Tsunami sits next to Grandfather.

TSUNAMI
Yes, please.

Grandfather prepares tea.

GRANDFATHER
I find your new appearance quite attractive.  You've taken the best
attributes of three women.

TSUNAMI
Thank you Yoshou.

Grandfather changes into Yoshou.

He pours tea for both of them.

YOSHOU
May we all find happiness.

Both drink.

Tsunami sets her cup down and leans over to Yoshou

She kisses him.

INT. Cave - DAY

Tenchi carrying Ayeka, Ryoko, and Sasami appear.

Tenchi sits down by the central pool cradling Ayeka in his lap.

Sasami pulls on Ryoko's sleeve and draws her to the far side of the room.

INT. Close up of Tenchi and Ayeka - DAY

TENCHI
Please come back to me Ayeka.

AYEKA
I'm tired of fighting Tenchi.  I'm so tired.

TENCHI
Please Ayeka, I love you with all my heart and with all my soul.

AYEKA
I don't know what love is any more.

RYOKO (O.C.)
What!

Ayeka buries her head in Tenchi's chest.

INT. Close up of Sasami and Ryoko - DAY

SASAMI
Please Ryoko.

RYOKO
Sasami I don't do that.

SASAMI
What about all those nights you spent with her.

RYOKO
I'd rock a sad little girl to sleep and watch over her like I did for
Tenchi.

SASAMI
Mihoshi will be gone for to long to wait for her.

RYOKO
You're barking up the wrong tree there too.

SASAMI
I though her and Kiyone would...  Well, you know.

RYOKO
I can tell you that they didn't.

SASAMI
Do you think Washu would do it?

RYOKO
Damn it Sasami, you have put me in a bad spot.  Are you sure that's what
she wants?

SASAMI
She said she was looking for a love that Misaki and Funaho shared.

RYOKO
I'll do it, but only if we try my way first.

SASAMI
What's your way?

RYOKO
We give up Tenchi so he can be with Ayeka.

SASAMI
What!

Sasami covers her mouth.

RYOKO
Now you know how I feel about this.

SASAMI
Ryoko you're coming up on your first anniversary.  I'm not even married
yet.

RYOKO
I'll give him up for her.

SASAMI
How long?

RYOKO
As long as it takes.

Sasami raises her eyebrows.

RYOKO
Let's say the month of June.

Sasami looks deflated.

SASAMI
Okay I agree, but if it doesn't work we try it my way.

RYOKO
Okay.

Sasami and Ryoko walk over to Tenchi and Ayeka.

INT. All four - DAY

Ryoko takes a hold of Tenchi and Sasami's hand.

The four disappear.

INT. Yukinojo's bridge - DAY

Mihoshi and Kazuhiko sit in the cocoon command chairs.

They are holding hands.

YUKINOJO
We have exited Ultra speed and have resumed normal speed.

MIHOSHI
Thank you Yukinojo.  I'm hungry.  Will you fix something to eat Kazuhiko?

KAZUHIKO
Of course Mihoshi.

Both get out of their chairs, and exit the bridge.

INT. Yukinojo's galley - DAY

Kazuhiko and Mihoshi walk in.

KAZUHIKO
What would you like?

MIHOSHI
Surprise me.

Kazuhiko pulls some items out of the refrigerator.

KAZUHIKO
Okay then.  We'll have blackened swordfish today with asparagus and
curried rice.

Mihoshi sits down at the table

MIHOSHI
Sounds good to me.

Kazuhiko begins preparing the meal.

KAZUHIKO
What do we do now?

MIHOSHI
What ever we must.

KAZUHIKO
Do you have a plan?

MIHOSHI
No, I never go into battle with a plan.

Kazuhiko turns and looks at her.

MIHOSHI
I've found plans are too restrictive.

Kazuhiko nods his head and returns to preparing the meal.

INT. Tenchi's bedroom - NIGHT

Tenchi cradling Ayeka, Ryoko, and Sasami appear.

Ryoko and Sasami leave the room.

Tenchi stands and moves over to the bed.

He lays Ayeka on the bed, and lays down next to her.

Ayeka places her head on Tenchi's chest.

AYEKA
I'm so afraid Tenchi.  I fear my future.  I fear my past.

TENCHI
I'm here now.  Let the past rest and the future take care of itself.

Ayeka falls asleep.

Tenchi lies awake staring at the ceiling.

INT. Grandfather's bedroom - NIGHT

Yoshou and Tsunami lay in bed under a sheet.

Yoshou is lays on his back, and Tsunami is to his right on her side
facing him.

TSUNAMI
Thank you Yoshou.  It has been awhile.

Yoshou does not respond.

TSUNAMI
What are you thinking?

YOSHOU
Who have I betrayed this time?

TSUNAMI
It can only be one person.  Did you betray yourself?

YOSHOU
Maybe.  I'm not sure.  Washu...

TSUNAMI
She can not hear you.  She has turned off all of her devises.

Yoshou looks at Tsunami.

YOSHOU
Do I pain her that much?

TSUNAMI
No, it is not that.  She has decided that our privacy is more important
than her research.

YOSHOU
I've grown tired of the chase.

TSUNAMI
The question is has she grown tired of the hunt?

Yoshou returns to looking at the ceiling.

TSUNAMI
Will you stay like this?

Yoshou closes his eyes.

Tsunami lays her hand on his chest and closes her eyes.

INT. Washu's lab - NIGHT

Washu sits on her pillow, with her hands behind her head, before her
keyboard.

She stares into space.

Washu sighs deeply and tears form in her eyes.

She stands and moves to the lab door.

She stands before the door looking down at her feet.

INT. Tenchi's bedroom - NIGHT

Tenchi lies in bed on his back.

Ayeka lays to his left, asleep, with her head on his chest.

The door opens and Sasami and Ryoko walk in with dinner trays.

They set the trays down on the table.

TENCHI
What are you two up to?

SASAMI
We're doing what we must to help Ayeka.

TENCHI
And what is that.

SASAMI
We have a couple of plans.

RYOKO
This is the first one.  Ayeka has you for the month of June.

TENCHI
The whole month?

Sasami and Ryoko nod their head.

TENCHI
But Ryoko, our anniversary is coming up this month.

Tears form in Ryoko's eyes.

RYOKO
I know that.  There are some things more important than an anniversary.
Ayeka's one of them.

TENCHI
If I fail what's your other plan?

SASAMI
We'll try to help Ayeka by...

Ryoko squeezes Sasami's shoulder.

RYOKO
Let's say we are all behind you Tenchi and we'll do whatever it takes
to help Ayeka.

TENCHI
Why?

SASAMI
We both love you two completely.  There is nothing you could ask of us
that we wouldn't do.

Ryoko nods her head in agreement.

TENCHI
Thank you.

Ryoko and Sasami leave the room.

AYEKA
How can anyone love a bitch like me?

TENCHI
You are a bitch Ayeka.

Ayeka's eyes fly open.

She looks up at Tenchi.

TENCHI
You've always been a bitch.  You were a bitch when we first met and you
sent Azaka and Kamidake after me.

Tears form in Ayeka's eyes.

Tenchi looks down at her with determination on his face.

TENCHI
Damn it Ayeka.  Don't you understand?  It's a part of you that I've
always known about.  Did you think I fell in love with an illusion?
That's the part of you that makes you strong.  I need that strength
for me to lean on when times get hard.

AYEKA
It fills me with hatred.

TENCHI
What has happened to you Ayeka?  You whine about your past like it makes
you a lesser person.  I love you Ayeka.  Your past made you what you are
today.  I don't hold it against you, nor do I discount it.  Your past is
a part of you and it's an important part.  You must decide what you will
use from your past to write your future.

AYEKA
I can't let go Tenchi.  I can't...

TENCHI (overlapping)
Don't let go Ayeka.  Take it in and use it to strengthen your resolve.
I want to be a part of your future.  I want our child to be a part of
your future.  I don't want to lose you like my father lost Achika.

Ayeka buries her face in Tenchi's chest.

AYEKA
But Tsunami...

TENCHI
Tsunami did me a favor Ayeka.  Do you know why I couldn't marry Sasami?

AYEKA
She's too young.

TENCHI
No, that isn't the problem.  I didn't love her as much as I loved you
and Ryoko.  Sasami told me herself that the moment I loved one wife more
that another it would all end.

AYEKA
And Tsunami changed that?

TENCHI
Yes she did.  I realized that I could love Sasami as much as I loved the
two of you.  I can marry her now.  We'll be complete at last.

Muffled laughter can be heard from Ayeka.

TENCHI
There's a sound that's music to my ears.

Ayeka looks up at Tenchi and stops laughing.

AYEKA
Damn you Tenchi.  How can I find joy in you marring my true sister?

TENCHI
Because Ayeka somewhere buried deep in your heart is a fountain of love.
I believe that its hardened cover has finally cracked.

Ayeka starts laughing again as she sits up in bed.

TENCHI
Are you hungry?

AYEKA
Yes.

Both get out of bed.

Ayeka goes into the bathroom while Tenchi sets the table.

Tenchi sits down.

Ayeka comes back out and sits on Tenchi's left.

AYEKA
I guess we should tell them that they don't have to wait the month.

TENCHI
Why.  They've already agreed to it.

AYEKA
Because I don't want to owe them for what...

TENCHI (overlapping)
Damn it Ayeka.  Don't you get it yet?  I love the three of you
completely.  Sasami loves the three of us completely.  Ryoko loves the
three of us completely.  You need to open your heart and let the love
out.  When we do something for each other there is no obligation.  We do
things out of our love for each other, and not because we have to.

AYEKA
I'm sorry Tenchi.

TENCHI
That is what you have become Ayeka, sorry.  We have a month together
to work it out so that you can love yourself.  Once you can do that you
will be able to love the rest of us, even Tsunami.

AYEKA
I...  I love you Tenchi.

Tenchi smiles at her.

TENCHI
I know that Ayeka.  I love you.  Together we can resolve this and give
you back the strength that you always had.  Even if you are a bitch at
times.

Tenchi starts chuckling and Ayeka joins in.

END ACT ONE



ACT TWO

FADE IN:

INT. Yukinojo's bridge - DAY (Saturday, 6 June 1998; 5th Day, 4th Month)

Mihoshi and Kazuhiko sit in their command chairs.

A star shows large on the view screen.

YUKINOJO
We've entered the SAR system.

Mihoshi looks at Kazuhiko.

KAZUHIKO
Scan the system for any other star ships.

YUKINOJO
Beginning Scan.

Mihoshi pulls out her cube.

KAZUHIKO
Are you trying to get some coffee?

Mihoshi nods her head.

Kazuhiko reaches down by his chair and pulls up a thermos.

KAZUHIKO
I have some right here.

MIHOSHI
How thoughtful of you.

Kazuhiko pours out some coffee.

KAZUHIKO
Actually I didn't want anything falling on my head like last time.

Mihoshi giggles and takes the coffee.

YUKINOJO
A large fleet is moving in from behind the larger gas planet.

MIHOSHI
Let's go see what they want.  Change course to intercept the fleet.

YUKINOJO
Changing course.

KAZUHIKO
Are you sure?

Mihoshi nods her head.

MIHOSHI
They may have information about Kiyone.

Small dots appear on the view screen.

They grow into thirty ships.

The ships have a long sleek look except for the bulky box structures on
each side.

MIHOSHI
They look very familiar.

YUKINOJO
Incoming message.

MIHOSHI
Put it on the screen.

A lizard man with a long snout appears on the screen.

KAZUHIKO
It's alligator men!

ALIEN COMMANDER
You now gaze upon the face of your death.

Mihoshi begins to chuckle.

She looks at Kazuhiko.

MIHOSHI
They're Asabariban.

Mihoshi turns her attention to the screen.

MIHOSHI
Is little Admiral Yuginogo there?

The alien blinks his eyes rapidly.

Another alien enters the scene and whispers in the first's ear.

ALIEN COMMANDER
Who are you?

MIHOSHI
I bet he is hiding where I can't see him.  My name is Mihoshi Kuramitsu.

The alien again blinks his eyes rapidly.

ALIEN COMMANDER
Surrender your ship or we will destroy you.

MIHOSHI
That's not very nice.

The door behind the alien commander opens, and another alien runs in.

ALIEN SUBORDINATE
Stop!  Stop!

The alien subordinate runs up to the commander and whispers in his ear.

The commander's eyes go wide.

He slams down on his chair arm.

ALIEN COMMANDER
Abort!  Abort!  Abo...

The screen returns to the alien ships.

All the ships power up their engines.

KAZUHIKO
They're all leaving at high speed.

MIHOSHI
I guess I won't be able to see little Admiral Yuginogo after all.

KAZUHIKO
How do you know them anyway?

MIHOSHI
It was Kiyone and my third mission together.  We were sent to protect
Parusoin, a little backwater planet like...

KAZUHIKO
Like Earth?

Mihoshi turns red.

MIHOSHI
I'm so sorry.

KAZUHIKO
Hey it's okay.  This little backwater planet boy is having the time of
his life.  If I hadn't come form Earth I would have never met you.

Mihoshi gives her winning smile.

MIHOSHI
Anyway a fleet came to conquer Parusoin, and the Galaxy Police couldn't
allow that.

KAZUHIKO
So you and Kiyone stopped an invasion fleet?

Mihoshi nods her head.

MIHOSHI
They had this really, really big ship and a bunch of little ships.  When
I asked them nicely to surrender.  Well this Asabariban told me the "I'm
the face of death" thing, and I asked him nicely to surrender again.

KAZUHIKO
Then they started shooting at you.

MIHOSHI
Wow!  It's like you were there.

KAZUHIKO
Some how your stories always have the bad guys shooting at you.

MIHOSHI
Well Kiyone and me boarded their ship but we got separated.  I wound up
on the on the bridge where I met Admiral Yuginogo.  He jumped at me and
I moved to one side and it tripped him up.  When he fell against a
console his hand opened this panel.  Inside was a big shiny red button.

Kazuhiko's face breaks out in a big grin.

KAZUHIKO
Let me guess.  You couldn't help yourself.  You had to push the button.

Mihoshi nods her head.

MIHOSHI
By pushing the button I dumped the computer core.  They could no longer
fire their weapons or bring their troops out of hibernation.

KAZUHIKO
What did the admiral think about that?

MIHOSHI
Oh my.  He turned a pale green and he started drooling.  Then he started
stuttering and then he was shouting.  Well I left the bridge immediately,
and he started chasing me.  I ran into Kiyone and we went and hid in the
engine room.  Kiyone jammed the door while I looked around.

KAZUHIKO
Did you find another red button?

Mihoshi nods her head.

MIHOSHI
It was under a thick Plexiglas cover.

KAZUHIKO
What did you do?

MIHOSHI
The Asabariban where trying to break in and demanded that we surrender.
Kiyone held the door while I made use of my screwdriver.  As soon as
I had the cover off I pushed the button.

KAZUHIKO
Then what?

MIHOSHI
The ship's power core was ejected.  All the lights went out and the life
support stopped working.

KAZUHIKO
That must have scared them.

MIHOSHI
Yes.  The Asabariban offered unconditional surrender.  Kiyone took care
of all the paper work and we left Parusoin.

KAZUHIKO
What about all the troops in hibernation?

MIHOSHI
I was worried about them, but the hibernation units had an independent
power source.  Most of the crew had to go into hibernation because there
was not enough room on the little ships.

KAZUHIKO
You amaze me Mihoshi.  I don't think there is anything you can't do when
you want to get it done.

MIHOSHI
You say such nice things Kazuhiko.

INT. Tenchi's bedroom - NIGHT

Tenchi is asleep in bed.

He opens his eyes.

Tenchi moves his arm to his left only to find no one there.

Tenchi sits up and looks around.

A light shines from under the bathroom door.

Tenchi gets out of bed dressed in his boxers.

He walks over to the bathroom door.

The sounds of someone throwing up.

TENCHI
Ayeka are you okay?

AYEKA
Leave me alone.

Tenchi opens the door.

Ayeka, wearing her inner wrap, is leaning over the toilet.

She throws up into the toilet.

TENCHI
Ayeka!

AYEKA
Go away!

Tenchi runs out of his bedroom.

INT. Third floor common area - NIGHT

Tenchi runs out of his room

TENCHI
Little Washu!  Little Washu!

Tenchi runs down the steps bouncing off the walls.

INT. Second floor common area - NIGHT

Tenchi comes running down the stairs.

TENCHI
Little Washu!  Little Washu!

Tenchi takes a wide turn heading down the next flight of stairs.

He is still bouncing off the walls.

INT. Main floor landing - NIGHT

Tenchi takes a wide turn and runs into Washu's lab door.

TENCHI
Little Wash...

Tenchi bounces off the door, and lands on his butt.

He quickly leaps to his feet and starts pounding on the door.

TENCHI
Little Washu!  Little Washu!

Tenchi runs back up the stairs.

INT. Third floor common area - NIGHT

Tenchi comes running up the stairs.

TENCHI
Ryoko!  Ryoko!

Tenchi runs up to Ryoko's door and starts pounding on it.

Tenchi's bedroom door opens and Ryoko stands in it wearing a kimono.

RYOKO
Would you calm down please?

Tenchi runs toward Ryoko.

TENCHI
Quick get Little Washu!  Ayeka's sick!

RYOKO
Let's see.  Tenchi runs around the house like a mad man yelling Little
Washu.  But can he just walk calmly over to my room, oh no.  He has to
go off like he's demon possessed.

TENCHI
Please, help Ayeka.

RYOKO
I called Washu when you first started yelling.  She's looking at Ayeka
now.

Tenchi tries to push past Ryoko, but Ryoko blocks his way.

RYOKO
Wait until nurse Washu is finished.

Tenchi looks into the room and sees the bathroom door open.

Sasami, in a kimono, walks out of the bathroom followed by Washu in her
nurse outfit.

SASAMI
Hello Tenchi.  Where were you?

Tenchi's shoulders slump.

WASHU
Everything is going to be okay.  Make sure Ayeka gets lots of fluids.
She'll have a hard time keeping solid food down for the next few weeks.

TENCHI
What's wrong with her?

WASHU
She is suffering from a hormonal imbalance.

Tenchi gives Washu a blank stare.

WASHU
The baby is hard on her body giving her what they call "morning
sickness".  It makes her stomach queasy.

Tenchi's face shows the "oh" of understanding.

RYOKO
Is that something I can look forward to?

WASHU
Yes, but the pain of birth will make you forget these minor
inconveniences.

TENCHI
Can I see her now?

WASHU
Yes, but she's sensitive about her condition.

SASAMI
She feels it is beneath a princess to be seen hugging a toilet.

Tenchi sees the three women out and closes the door.

TENCHI
Ayeka, can I come in?

AYEKA
I'm not looking pretty right now.

Tenchi enters the bathroom.

TENCHI
That's okay.

Ayeka again throws up in the toilet.

Tenchi moves behind her and grasps her shoulders.

When Ayeka is done he reaches down and turns her face.

Ayeka's eyes go wide.

Tenchi kisses her on the forehead.

Ayeka turns red.

TENCHI
There's nothing about you I don't love.  Our child has brought this
on you, and we'll share this together.

AYEKA
I love you Tenchi.

Tenchi smiles.

TENCHI
And I love you.  I'll wait for you in bed.

Tenchi runs his fingers through her hair.

Tenchi walks out of the bathroom to hear Ayeka throwing up again.

Tenchi climbs back into bed.

INT. Yukinojo's  bridge - DAY (Sunday, 7 June 1998; 6th Day, 4th Month)

Mihoshi and Kazuhiko sit in the command chairs.

A blue green planet is on the view screen.

YUKINOJO
We're in orbit around Sirius Three.

MIHOSHI
Look for Yagami and Kiyone.

YUKINOJO
Scanning now.

KAZUHIKO
Did you consider that the message could have been faked?

Mihoshi is staring at the screen.

KAZUHIKO
Mihoshi?  Mihoshi!

MIHOSHI
What?  Oh, yes I thought about it.  I know it's real though.

Kazuhiko nods his head.

KAZUHIKO
So what do we do while we wait.

MIHOSHI
Something to eat would be nice.

Kazuhiko shakes his head.

KAZUHIKO
Somehow I knew you would say that.

Kazuhiko gets up to leaves the bridge.

YUKINOJO
Incoming missiles!

MIHOSHI
Defensive maneuvers now.

YUKINOJO
Initiating maneuvers.

KAZUHIKO
Target missile launch sites.

YUKINOJO
Launch sites identified.

KAZUHIKO
What do we have to take out the missile sites?

MIHOSHI
Use the gamma beam weapon.

YUKINOJO
Using the gamma beam weapon to neutralize the missile sites.

Mihoshi and Kazuhiko watch the screen as the incoming missiles are
destroyed.

YUKINOJO
All launch sites destroyed.

KAZUHIKO
Sorry about that.

MIHOSHI
That's okay.  Sometimes you must act decisively.

KAZUHIKO
I know you regret taking lives.

MIHOSHI
I don't regret it.  I just try to avoid it when I can.  Too many have
died by my hand.

KAZUHIKO
Somebody does not want us in orbit.

MIHOSHI
Yukinojo look for fortified positions near the missile launch sites.

YUKINOJO
There is a level eight force field in the area.  If covers five square
miles.

KAZUHIKO
How hard is it to break through a level eight force field?

MIHOSHI
The gamma beam weapon would cut right through it, but the implosion
would destroy everything under the field.

KAZUHIKO
Hmmm.  How do we get in?  Can you destroy the power source like that
other time?

MIHOSHI
Yukinojo?

YUKINOJO
The power source is self-contained within the force field.

MIHOSHI
Can you identify the power source based on emissions?

YUKINOJO
I project at eighty four percent that it is a type three fusion reactor.

Mihoshi smiles.

KAZUHIKO
What does that mean?

MIHOSHI
They're using a water cooled nuclear reactor.  It has an external
cooling source such as a river or ocean.

KAZUHIKO
So if we cut off the source...

MIHOSHI
They'll have to shut down the reactor.

Kazuhiko joins Mihoshi in a big smile.

KAZUHIKO
Couldn't we enter through the water source?

MIHOSHI
That would be a bad thing.  There are too many ways to defend against
that entry.  Yukinojo please identify the most likely cooling sources.

YUKINOJO
There is one river entering the force field area.

KAZUHIKO
So are we going to dam it up?

Mihoshi nods her head.

MIHOSHI
Yukinojo plan a missile spread to pile rubble against the force field
at the river entrance.

YUKINOJO
Plotted.

MIHOSHI
For Kiyone.  Execute plan Yukinojo.

EXT. Space - DAY

Yukinojo in orbit around a blue green planet.

Several missiles are fired from Yukinojo.

The missiles head for the planets surface.

EXT. Force field - DAY

A river enters the force field.

A series of explosions around the river entrance.

Smoke covers the area.

When the smoke clears rubble is piled up against the force field.

The river now flows to the left and right of the force field flooding
the community built up around the protected area.

INT. Yukinojo's bridge - DAY

Mihoshi sits in her command chair.

Kazuhiko stands behind his.

Mihoshi pulls out her cube and gives it a couple of twists.

She changes into her Galaxy Police uniform.

MIHOSHI
That flooding is going to displace a lot of people.

KAZUHIKO
They should've thought of that before taking Kiyone.

Mihoshi nods her head.

KAZUHIKO
When will I get one of those cubes?

MIHOSHI
Headquarters will send you one once they acknowledge you are a Galaxy
Policeman.

KAZUHIKO
I'm going to get my uniform on.

MIHOSHI
Take your time.  It will be awhile before they're forced to shut down
the reactor.

KAZUHIKO
When they do, they'll be ready for us.

Mihoshi nods her head again.

Kazuhiko exits the bridge.

INT. Yukinojo's bridge - NIGHT

Mihoshi is asleep in her command chair.

Kazuhiko enters the bridge wearing his Galaxy Police uniform.

He has two swords through a sash on his left side and a Washu issued
rifle over his right shoulder.

He balances two trays in his hands.

Kazuhiko sets one tray on the console in front of Mihoshi and set the
other on his console.

Kazuhiko sits on the arm of his chair and watches Mihoshi sleep.

MIHOSHI
Are you going to watch me all day or did you plan on telling me dinner
was ready.

Mihoshi opens her eyes and looks at Kazuhiko

KAZUHIKO
You're so beautiful.  You must hear that a lot.

MIHOSHI
I hear it a lot, but seldom does anyone mean what they say.

Mihoshi picks up her tray and starts eating.

Kazuhiko sits down in his chair and starts eating.

KAZUHIKO
You love him, don't you?

MIHOSHI
Of course I do.  Don't you love Tenchi?

Kazuhiko turns red.

KAZUHIKO
Ah...  But...  I just...

MIHOSHI
I love him like the brother I never had.  Wait.  You were thinking
of something else, weren't you?

Kazuhiko turns a bright red.

KAZUHIKO
I'm sorry.

MIHOSHI
Talk about love and all people think about is sex.  You should know that
you're a lot like Ryoko.

KAZUHIKO
I am?

Mihoshi nods her head.

MIHOSHI
She is loyal, jumps to conclusions, and doesn't let being right or wrong
slow her down.

KAZUHIKO
I will have to take that as a compliment.

Mihoshi smiles.

MIHOSHI
Are you sure you want to go down there?  I may be lucky but I can't
guarantee that you'll be safe.

KAZUHIKO
Have you ever lost a partner?

Mihoshi's face saddens.

KAZUHIKO
Please forgive me.  I didn't mean to stir up old memories.

MIHOSHI
It was long ago, shortly after I joined the Galaxy Police.

KAZUHIKO
Let's think about rescuing Kiyone.  We can talk about old times over
a drink some other day.

Mihoshi's smile returns.

Both continue eating.

YUKINOJO
The force field has dropped.  There are spacecraft rising from the
surface.

MIHOSHI
We're coming, Kiyone.  Just hold on for a few more minutes.

FADE OUT:

END ACT TWO



ACT THREE

FADE IN:

INT. Family Room - NIGHT

Ayeka, Ryoko, Sasami, Ryo-Ohki, Tsunami, and Washu sit watching
television.

A soap opera is on.

Ryo-Ohki has carrot juice while the rest enjoy tea.

Everyone is eating carrot cake.

Tenchi enters the room and sits down between Ayeka and Ryoko.

SASAMI
Would you like some tea and cake Tenchi?

TENCHI
Yes please.

Sasami brings Tenchi some tea and cake.

SASAMI
I wonder how Mihoshi and Kazuhiko are doing?

TENCHI
I doubt they've even gotten there yet.

WASHU
Mihoshi will be there when she needs to be there.  I just hope she can
be here when she needs to be here.

AYEKA
Are you still worried that the Lady may be involved?

WASHU
I'm always worried that the Lady is involved.  What do you think Tsunami?

Tsunami stares into her teacup.

RYOKO
Hoping to read the future in the leaves?

TSUNAMI
I can no longer tell what the Lady is doing.  She has cut me off from
her plans, and that worries me.

TENCHI
Anything that worries Tsunami is enough to worry me.

SASAMI
We'll just have to be ready for anything.

WASHU
I've done everything I can think of to be prepared.

TENCHI
I've faith in our abilities.  Together we can overcome anything.

AYEKA
True, but we're not all together.

Everyone nods their head.

INT. Yukinojo's bridge - NIGHT

Mihoshi and Kazuhiko stand on the bridge.

Mihoshi is wearing her Galaxy Police uniform and has her blaster drawn.

She has a holographic visor in front of her eyes.

Kazuhiko is wearing his Galaxy Police uniform and is carrying his Washu
built rifle.

Both of his swords are in his sash on the left side.

Mihoshi hands him an earpiece.

MIHOSHI
This is a communicator and heads up display.  It'll help you see better
at night.

Kazuhiko places it in his right ear.

The holographic visor appears in front of his eyes.

KAZUHIKO
This is cool.  Is this standard issue?

MIHOSHI
Ah, no.

KAZUHIKO
It must be nice to be the Grand Marshall's granddaughter.

MIHOSHI
The only thing I ever got because of the Grand Marshall was the original
Yukinojo.

KAZUHIKO
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean that you used your relationship to your
advantage.

MIHOSHI
That's okay.  I'm a little too touchy about it.

KAZUHIKO
What will we do about those spacecraft?

MIHOSHI
Nothing.  Have you finished scanning the buildings Yukinojo?

KAZUHIKO
Nothing?

YUKINOJO
I have finished scanning the area.  There are six major buildings and
forty-two smaller buildings.  I have eliminated all but two major
buildings as to having Kiyone.  I estimate a seventy eight percent
chance she is in the building at 90.4 mark 74.

KAZUHIKO
Guards?

YUKINOJO
There are two life forms guarding the area.  The native Siriusians,
and the Furrarizan.

MIHOSHI
Furrarizan?  What in the hell are they doing here?  Is there any
Furrarizan craft rising up?

YUKINOJO
No, all the craft are of local make.

KAZUHIKO
What are the Furrarizan?

MIHOSHI
A warrior cat like race from another galaxy.

KAZUHIKO
Do they know about you?

Mihoshi shakes her head.

MIHOSHI
I know of them based on stories my mother told me when I was little.
Can you estimate the technology of their weapons, Yukinojo?

YUKINOJO
The Siriusians are consistent with their Tech Level eight world.  The
Furrarizan are approximately Tech Level twelve.

KAZUHIKO
What does all that mean?

MIHOSHI
The Galaxy Police are Tech Level fourteen, and that rifle of Ms. Washu's
would be considered Tech Level fifteen.

KAZUHIKO
So we have some advantage.

MIHOSHI
Not as much as I'd like.  The Furrarizan are going to be a problem.

KAZUHIKO
Can you scan inside the building Yukinojo?

YUKINOJO
Negative.  Something in the construction is blocking my scans.

KAZUHIKO
I'd recommend a smash and grab.  We blast the defenses outside the
target building and the building's entrance.  We teleport down and enter.
Hopefully our scanners will work once we're inside.

MIHOSHI
Let's go with that plan Yukinojo.  Evade the on coming craft after we're
on the surface.

YUKINOJO
Standby for transport.

EXT. Building - NIGHT

The building looks like a blockhouse with no windows.

There are bunkers around the building and several gun emplacements.

A large number of soldiers surround the building, both human and cat
like.

Several beams of energy strike the front of the building and the
surrounding area.

Mihoshi and Kazuhiko appear in front of the breach in the building.

Both rush inside.

INT. Building corridor - NIGHT

Mihoshi and Kazuhiko run down the corridor.

An alarm is sounding.

KAZUHIKO
Picking anything up yet?

MIHOSHI
No, nothing on my scanner.  We need to get deeper into the building.

They run a little further.

MIHOSHI
Stop!

Kazuhiko drops to the ground with rifle ready.

Mihoshi kneels.

Several soldiers round the corner.

Kazuhiko fires some high explosive rounds while Mihoshi uses her blaster.

MIHOSHI
They must be the locals.  They have no force field technology.

KAZUHIKO
Which means it'll get worse further in.

MIHOSHI
I'm afraid so.

Mihoshi and Kazuhiko stand up.

They move beyond the carnage.

INT. Corridor - NIGHT

Mihoshi enters followed by Kazuhiko.

MIHOSHI
There's a large open area ahead.  We need to make a dash across it.

KAZUHIKO
It looks like an ambush to me.

Mihoshi starts out at a run closely followed by Kazuhiko.

Mihoshi trips and falls bringing Kazuhiko down with her.

A white sheet of light appears about two feet above the floor.

Kazuhiko shudders.

KAZUHIKO
That would've been nasty if we were still standing.

MIHOSHI
I'm getting a reading below us.

KAZUHIKO
How do we get down?

Mihoshi pulls out her cube and begins twisting it.

MIHOSHI
They'll soon check to see if the trap got us.

A blanket pops out of the cube.

KAZUHIKO
A blanket?

MIHOSHI
Put an edge of this under you and get ready to wrap it around us.

A dinner plate pops out.

Mihoshi sets the dinner plate on the floor upside down.

She pushes a button on the plate, and dives on top of Kazuhiko.

Kazuhiko wraps the blanket around them.

The dinner plate explodes.

All the shrapnel bounces off the blanket.

Kazuhiko removes the blanket.

There is a ten foot wide hole in the floor.

KAZUHIKO
Remind me to be extra careful when you invite me over to eat.

Mihoshi giggles.

She crawls over to the hole.

MIHOSHI
It's about twenty feet to the floor below.

Kazuhiko moves to the edge.

Mihoshi goes through the hole, head first.

She does a summersault and lands on her feet.

Mihoshi immediately crouches and starts blasting away.

Kazuhiko jumps in feet first.

He lands and does a roll coming up with his rifle ready.

He fires some high explosive rounds in the direction Mihoshi was
shooting.

He sees a glow in the area he is firing.

KAZUHIKO
What's that?

MIHOSHI
Force field.  Keep up the fire.

Mihoshi pulls out her cube and gives it a few twists.

Out pops two small globes.

She tosses one at the enemy.

It makes a small noise and the glow disappears.

KAZUHIKO
They're retreating.

MIHOSHI
Good.

She points to her right.

MIHOSHI
Kiyone is behind that wall.

Kazuhiko runs low to the wall with Mihoshi following.

KAZUHIKO
Blow a hole or find a door?

MIHOSHI
Find a door.

Kazuhiko moves along the wall staying low.

Mihoshi follows close behind.

KAZUHIKO
I hear something mechanical up ahead.  I think it sounds like your robot
battle suit.

Mihoshi holds up the other small globe.

MIHOSHI
That's why I have another one of these.

Kazuhiko looks the globe and then at her.

MIHOSHI
It generates an electromagnetic pulse.

Kazuhiko nods his head.

He crouches down lower.

KAZUHIKO
Here they come.

Mihoshi tosses the globe as the first robot rounds the corner.

It makes a small noise as it explodes.

The robot stops moving.

Mihoshi stands and runs for the corner.

Kazuhiko follows close behind.

Mihoshi dives past the corner rolling on the ground.

Kazuhiko takes a position at the corner with the wall for protection.

Both fire down the hallway.

Four of the Furrarizan are cut down without returning a shot.

Mihoshi stands and races to the door they were guarding.

Kazuhiko is close behind.

MIHOSHI
You'll have to blow the door.

Kazuhiko sets the switch on his rifle.

It makes a zipper noise as he cuts out the door hinges and lock.

Kazuhiko kicks the door into the room.

Mihoshi dives through the opening rolling along the ground looking left.

Kazuhiko follows looking right.

MIHOSHI
Oh, Kiyone!

Kazuhiko looks behind him.

Mihoshi falls to her knees and begins bawling.

Kiyone hangs naked by her manacled wrists from a ring high on a pole.

Her feet do not touch the ground.

She is badly beaten.

Kazuhiko draws his long sword and approaches Kiyone.

MIHOSHI
I'm so sorry Kiyone.  I tried to get here as fast as I could.

He cuts at the chains over her head severing them easily.

Kazuhiko catches her over his left shoulder.

KAZUHIKO
You're in time Mihoshi.  She still breathes.  We need to get her medical
attention right away.

Mihoshi nods her head.

Kazuhiko sets Kiyone down.

Mihoshi stands up and walks over to them.

Kazuhiko removes his jacket and wraps it around Kiyone.

Mihoshi touches Kiyone's cheek.

MIHOSHI
We need to find Yagami too.

KAZUHIKO
Yagami is just a...  Just a...

Kazuhiko locks eyes with Mihoshi.

KAZUHIKO
God I'm a fool.  Yes, of course we need to find Yagami.

Mihoshi smiles.

KAZUHIKO
How do we find Yagami?

MIHOSHI
We passed a control room on the way here.

KAZUHIKO
We won't be able to get Kiyone up that hole.

MIHOSHI
Then we'll find the stairs.

KAZUHIKO
A good place to look would be where that last ambush happened.

Kazuhiko sheaths his long sword and picks up Kiyone over his left
shoulder.

He checks his rifle.

KAZUHIKO
I have it set for high explosives.

Mihoshi nods her head.

Mihoshi moves to the exit and looks out.

Kazuhiko stays close behind her.

KAZUHIKO
I'm surprised we have gone this long without an attack.

Mihoshi plays with her bracelet.

MIHOSHI
Hmm, I don't detect anyone in the area.

Mihoshi looks at Kazuhiko.

MIHOSHI
Can you fight and carry Kiyone at the same time?

KAZUHIKO
I'll have to.  Do you have any more of those silver globes?

Mihoshi holds up one globe.

MIHOSHI
This is the last one.

Mihoshi moves out into the corridor.

They make their way to where they entered through the ceiling.

KAZUHIKO
The hole is covered with something.

Mihoshi checks her bracelet.

MIHOSHI
It's a force field.

She looks at her bracelet.

MIHOSHI
I still don't detect anyone.

Kazuhiko and Mihoshi rush over to where the last attack came from.

KAZUHIKO
They left their dead behind.  There's another one of those force fields
blocking that area up ahead.

MIHOSHI
They're trying to trap us on this floor.

Mihoshi moves back around the corner and motions to Kazuhiko.

Kazuhiko moves to join her.

Mihoshi rolls the silver globe at the force field.

A loud pop is heard.

Mihoshi charges around the corner with her blaster raised.

Kazuhiko follows close behind.

Several Furrarizan stand in surprise.

Kazuhiko sends a high explosive round into their midst.

Mihoshi opens up with her blaster.

Both rush past the stunned Furrarizan.

MIHOSHI
There's the stairs.

Kazuhiko follows her up the stairs.

He fires another explosive round behind him.

Mihoshi turns left at the top of the stairs.

Kazuhiko changes settings on his rifle.

MIHOSHI
Through that door.  Try not to destroy any of the equipment.

KAZUHIKO
Right.

Mihoshi sticks a small box on the door.

Both move to either side of the door.

Mihoshi holds up three fingers, then two, and then one.

The box makes a small explosion.

Kazuhiko kicks in the door, and Mihoshi charges in.

Mihoshi blasts two Furrarizan holding rifles.

Kazuhiko charges in behind her and raises his rifle.

MIHOSHI
Don't kill him!

Kazuhiko spins the rifle striking the last big cat under the jaw.

The Furrarizan goes down spiting blood.

Kazuhiko sticks the rifle muzzle under the Furrarizan chin.

The big cat hisses and growls

KAZUHIKO
I can't understand anything it's saying.

MIHOSHI
I'll get to that later.

Mihoshi looks around the control room.

She spots one control and starts pushing buttons on it.

KAZUHIKO
Can you understand the symbols?

Mihoshi nods her head.

A voice starts coming from the control unit.

Mihoshi plays with her bracelet.

The voice is counting down from one hundred forty two.

MIHOSHI
We should be able to understand the Furrarizan now.

The Furrarizan looks at them both.

FURRARIZAN
What have you done?

Mihoshi smiles at the big cat.

MIHOSHI
Where's the ship that the captive came in?

The Furrarizan spits at her.

KAZUHIKO
Take Kiyone.

Mihoshi takes Kiyone and places her in one of the bowl like hairs.

Kazuhiko draws his long sword.

KAZUHIKO
How do you think he would look like with out ears?

The cat's eyes go wide.

MIHOSHI
He's kind of cute right now.  It would definitely be a step backwards.

Kazuhiko presses the blade against the base of his ear.

The ear flinches away.

KAZUHIKO
Where's her starship?

The countdown reaches sixty.

FURRARIZAN
Destroyed.

MIHOSHI
And the parts you recovered?

His eyes flick toward a doorway.

MIHOSHI
Hold him while I check it out.

Mihoshi exits through the doorway.

The countdown has reached twenty.

She returns carrying a small black box.

MIHOSHI
You can let him go.

Kazuhiko backs away.

The Furrarizan leaps to his feet and rushes over to the control panel.

The countdown stops at twelve.

Mihoshi touches him with the butt of her blaster.

The big cat convulses and collapses to the floor.

MIHOSHI
Built in electric stun.

Kazuhiko sheathes his sword and picks up Kiyone.

He grabs his rifle.

They both move to the door.

MIHOSHI
I'm hoping that they cleared the building.

Mihoshi touches her bracelet.

MIHOSHI
Yukinojo.

She shakes her head.

MIHOSHI
We need to get closer to the outside.

Both Kazuhiko and Mihoshi head back the way they entered.

Mihoshi calls to Yukinojo every couple of steps.

MIHOSHI
Damn it, Yukinojo, answer me!

Kazuhiko's eyes go wide.

KAZUHIKO
Are you all right Mihoshi?

MIHOSHI
We're running out of time.

INT. Tenchi's bedroom - NIGHT

Tenchi's room is lit only by the moonlight though the skylight window.

Tenchi lies in bed alone.

An incredibly loud siren begins.

Tenchi sits up in bed and clamps his hands over his ears.

He looks around and sees that he is alone.

There is a light shining under the bathroom door.

Tenchi gets out of bed dressed in his boxers.

He exits the room.

In the common area stand Ryoko and Sasami with their hands over their
ears.

Tenchi runs past them and heads down the stairs.

The girls follow.

INT. Second floor common area - NIGHT

Ryo-Ohki is running in circles with her hands over her ears.

Tenchi, Ryoko, and Sasami run in from the third floor.

They continue down to the first floor.

Ryo-Ohki follows.

INT. First floor landing - NIGHT

Tenchi, Ryoko, Sasami, and Ryo-Ohki run in from the stairs.

Tenchi runs into Washu's lab door.

He pushes on it but it does not open.

Everyone appears to be talking but nothing can be heard above the siren.

Tenchi starts kicking at the lab door.

INT. Bunker corridor - NIGHT

Mihoshi and Kazuhiko make their way down the corridor.

Kazuhiko is carrying Kiyone over his left shoulder.

Mihoshi comes to a stop.

MIHOSHI
There's more of the enemy up ahead, and I still can't reach Yukinojo.

Kazuhiko moves slowly to the corner.

He fires some high explosive rounds toward the opponents.

He takes a quick peek.

KAZUHIKO
They have force fields.  Do you have another EMP globe?

MIHOSHI
No.

KAZUHIKO
How about some more of those dinner plates.

MIHOSHI
I have several of them.

KAZUHIKO
Give me two.  I left the blanket.  Do you have another?

Mihoshi shakes her head.

KAZUHIKO
I guess we'll have to do without.

Kazuhiko places a diner plate on the wall.

KAZUHIKO
Let's move back.

Both move back.

Kazuhiko kneels and takes aim at the dinner plate.

He fires one round.

The plate explodes leaving a large hole in the wall.

Both move forward to the hole.

They look into a storeroom that has been shredded.

Both go in.

KAZUHIKO
I hope that's an outside wall.

Kazuhiko places another dinner plate against the far wall.

They move behind some equipment.

Kazuhiko takes aim and fires.

The dinner plate explodes.

They can see stars through the hole.

YUKINOJO (O. C.)
Are you there Mihoshi

MIHOSHI
Transport us now!

Both disappear.

INT. Yukinojo's bridge - NIGHT

The bridge is filled with smoke.

Mihoshi and Kazuhiko appear.

Kazuhiko is carrying Kiyone.

Both look around.


MIHOSHI
Yukinojo?!

KAZUHIKO
What happened?

YUKINOJO
There were three attempts to capture or destroy me.

MIHOSHI
Are you all right?

YUKINOJO
Propulsion and Navigation are fully operational.  Life support is
minimal.

MIHOSHI
Rig for ultra speed.

YUKINOJO
We are still within the galactic plane.

MIHOSHI
Please.

The command chairs reform in to the cocoon shapes.

MIHOSHI
Prepare my stateroom for one passenger.

YUKINOJO
Done.

Mihoshi looks at Kazuhiko.

MIHOSHI
Please put Kiyone in my stateroom, and make sure she's secure.

Kazuhiko nods his head and leaves the room.

YUKINOJO
There is a one point three percent chance of collision.

MIHOSHI
I'm sorry.

YUKINOJO
There is a zero point nine percent chance that I will survive the
transit.

MIHOSHI
We may be too late already.

YUKINOJO
I understand.  The ship is prepared for ultra speed.

MIHOSHI
Thank you Yukinojo.

Mihoshi sits in her command chair.

Tears stream from her face.

INT. First floor landing - NIGHT

A very loud siren sounds.

Tenchi is kicking Washu's lab door.

Ryoko, Sasami, and Ryo-Ohki watch.

Everyone has their hands over their ears.

The door opens and Washu steps out with a big grin.

Her mouth moves but nothing can be heard.

Tenchi yells at her but can't hear himself.

Washu's keyboard appears.

She types a command.

The sound stops.

TENCHI
Washu what are you doing!  Oh, sorry about that.

Tenchi, Ryoko, and Sasami drop their hands.

WASHU
It works.

RYOKO
What works?

WASHU
My newest invention for protection of course.

SASAMI
Of course, and what is this invention.

WASHU
Interstellar early warning device.

Sasami notices that Ryo-Ohki still has her ears covered.

Sasami gently lowers Ryo-Ohki's hands.

RYO-OHKI
Miya?

TENCHI
What does this warning device do?

WASHU
It alarms when ten or more capital ships enter the solar system without
transponders.

TENCHI
What's a capital ship?

WASHU
Something like a Jurai Battle Cruiser.  50,000 tons or more.

Tenchi nods his head.

TENCHI
So you're saying that at least ten ships that are 50,000 tons or more
have entered the solar system without transponders.

Washu smiles and nods her head vigorously.

She locks eyes with Tenchi and stops smiling.

Both their eyes open wide.

TENCHI and WASHU
Oh no!

INT. Yukinojo's bridge - NIGHT

Mihoshi sits in her command chair crying.

Kazuhiko enters the bridge.

He is wearing his jacket and still has his weapons.

He kneels beside Mihoshi

KAZUHIKO
Kiyone's strapped in.  I gave her something to keep her sleeping during
the journey.

Mihoshi nods her head.

KAZUHIKO
Are you okay?

Mihoshi shakes her head.

MIHOSHI
We're too late.

Kazuhiko takes a hold of her shoulder.

KAZUHIKO
Didn't Tenchi say that you were always where you needed to be when you
needed to be there?

Mihoshi nods her head.

She can barely speak.

MIHOSHI
Yes.

KAZUHIKO
Then have a little faith.  You were in time to save Kiyone, and you'll
be in time to save Tenchi.

Mihoshi smiles.

MIHOSHI
Thank you.

Kazuhiko smiles.

He straps himself in his chair.

KAZUHIKO
Just doing my job as a Galaxy Police Policeman.

Mihoshi drops the ultra energy cylinder into the tube.

MIHOSHI
Let's go Yukinojo.

EXT. Space - NIGHT

The rear of Yukinojo fills the screen.

The engines flare a bright white.

The ship disappears.

FADE OUT:

THE END
