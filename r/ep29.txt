(This episode takes place in June, two months after the last episode.
SCENE: Miho-Kiyo(and Seion's) place. 11:30 at night. Seion is out on
the balcony looking out on 
the city when he see's a car go outta control and head for the
apartment building he just happens to be standing in. He runs into the
apartment and says....
SEION: MIHOSHI! KIYONE! INCOMING CAR! GET DOWN!
SFX: Thunderous CRASH! as the car slams into the building. The room
begins to tilt.
KIYONE: Why does this always have to happen to me?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SFX: Eeeeeeeeeeoooo!
EPISODE 29: NO NEED FOR EVOLVING
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SCENE: The Masaki residence. 2 hours later (1:35am). Noboyuki, Tenchi,
Nagi, and Yosho are helping Kiyone, Mihoshi and Seion unload their
things from the van.
KIYONE: It was really nice of you to help us out Mr. Masaki.
NOBOYUKI: It's alright, Kiyone. And please, you don't have to call me
Mr. Masaki.
KIYONE: Thank you, Noboyuki.
NOBOYUKI: Thats more like it. You two girls can have the new guest
room we just finished.
MIHOSHI: Yippee! We get our own room! It'll be just like the Academey!
SEION: And where will I be staying, Nobi ol' buddy?
NOBOYUKI: You still call me Mr. Masaki. And you'll be staying in
Tenchi's room.
TENCH: WAIT A MINUTE! Why do I have to sleep in the same room with
this looney?
NOBOYUKI:(taking Tenchi aside) Look, I'm working on his sister and
it'd be kinda hard to do anything with him in the room.
TENCHI: Oh, I see. You just want to--
SEION: So whatta ya say roomie? Ya up for a game of poker?
KIYONE: No grifting, Seion?
SEION: Aw, rassberries!
KIYONE: And stop quoting the Simpson! I don't know-(Stubs her toe on
the step) D'OH!
NAGI: Just be careful, Tenchi. He snores.
SEION: So do you, Nagi. Remember that time when we-
NAGI: Let's not talk about that in front of the Jurians.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: 3:47am that same morning. The house is peaceful and quite
until....
SASAMI: AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
AEKA:(sleepily) ...what is it Sasami..Yawnnnnn...?
SASAMI:(scared) There were two monsters in our room. When I screamed
they ran into the closet.
AEKA: Look now. There is no such thing as closet monsters! Now go back
to sleep!
SASAMI: But I'm too scared.(Sasami starts crying)
(the door opens up and the gang is at the doorway looking in)
TENCHI: What's wrong, Sasami?
SASAMI: Oh, Tennnnnchiiiiiii! There's two monsters in the closet and
they scared me.
TENCH: Two closet monsters? That is scary.
RYOKO: Is that all? Jeeze! The things some people are scared of!
SEION: Bran muffins!
RYOKO: (frightened) WHERE? WHERE?! AAAAAHHHHH!!!!! (Ryoko jumps out
the nearest window)
AEKA: You don't honestly believe that there are such things as "closet
monsters", do you, Lord Tenchi?
SASAMI: Can I sleep in your room tonight, Tenchi?
TENCHI: I guess so.
SEION: And don't worry about those closet monsters, oh Kawaii
princess. Me and Tenchi will exterminate them for you! It'll be a geat
training exercise.
SASAMI: Thank you! Will you help them Nagi?
NAGI: Only because you asked me to, Sasami.
SASAMI: Great!
AEKA: (to herself) If Sasami can get into Tenchi's room by saying that
she is scared then..... (aloud)Tenchi! Come with you? I'm scared too!
TENCHI: Sorry, but there isn't that much room and Seion and I have to
get ready.
SEION: Besides, didn't you say that there is no such thing as closet
monsters?
(the lights go off, the door closes, and Aeka sits alone in the dark.
Just then the closet door cracks open and two sets of eyes, one red
and one yellow, peer out at Aeka and make eye contact with her. Aeka
begins to shiver and wet herself.)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE:8:45. outside of Sasami's room. Tenchi is in a Jurian
battlesuit, Nagi is in her bounty hunter outfit and Seion is wearing
black kung-fu pants and a tiger skin as a cloak with the head acting
as a hood. Sasami, Mihoshi, Kiyone, Yosho, and Noboyuki are with them.
SEION: Are you two ready?
TENCHI: As I'll ever be.
NAGI: Let's just go in.
SEION: Wish us luck.
MIHOSHI: Don't get killed by the monsters.
KIYONE: Uhh..yeah. Just don't kill each other.
TENCHI: We're going in!
(They enter the room and close the door. The scene is still in the
hallway but we hear their voices from in the room)
-SEION: Alright, Tenchi, you get the door. Nagi and I'll cover you.
-TENCHI: Okay, here goes! Look at those two-
-MONSTER A: HISSSSSSSSSS!
CUE RYOKO'S THEME (from the OVA Best Album 1)
-TENCHI: WATCHOUT SEION! HE'S CHARGING YOU!
-SEION: ARRRGGGG! WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THERE WERE REAL MONSTERS IN
THIS PLACE? DON'T JUST STAND THERE, NAGI! QUICK, THROW ME MY SPEAR!
-NAGI: HERE YOU GO!
-SEION: AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! AAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!! OOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWW!
IT'S IN THE BONE! It's in the bone!
YOSHO: Sounds like a pretty tough monster, Sasami.
SASAMI: Oh, it was, Grandpa! One of them had big yellow eyes and brown
fur just like Ryo-oki and the other had red eyes just like Ken-oki!
They were trying to get into the carrots I had left out for
Ry-oki..and...Ken....oh, no! (Sasami opens the door and storms in)
Tenchi! Seion! Stop! Its-(Sasami starts giggling when she see's
Ken-oki bouncing on the closet door that Tenchi happens to be under
and Ryo-oki grabbing Nagi by the hair and bashing her head into a
pillow. Seion is trying to get the spear outta his leg. Oh, by the
way, The cabbits happen to look a lot like people now)-it's Ryo-oki
and Ken-oki!
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
SFX: Eeeeyoooo! (wood blocks)
(picture of Ryo-oki and Ken-oki in ship form bumping into each other)
=====================================================
COMMERCIAL BREAK
How Detective First Class Mihoshi eats a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup
MIHOSHI: Oh, boy! Chocolate and Peanut butter!
(Mihoshi bites into it, wrapping and all!)
KIYONE: Jeeze, Mihoshi. Unwrap it first!
Okay, so there is one wrong way-
MIHOSHI: Yummy!
-to eat a Reese's.
=====================================================
SFX:Eeeeyoooo!(wood blocks)
(picture of the cabbits with a buch of carrots slung over Ken-oki's
back)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
SCENE: Washu's Lab
WASHU A: You did it, Washu! 
WASHU B: Your a genuis, Washu!
WASHU: As if there was any doubt! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
(Just then any angry mob storms through the door)
TENCHI: Alright Washu! Start explaining!
WASHU: You mean about the cabbits! I can but I'm not gonna do it! Not
until you call me-
ALL: Little Washu!
SASAMI: Please, Miss Washu, can you change them back.
WASHU: I didn't do this to them. They did it themselves. I just helped
them a little.
TENCHI: How much is a little?
WASHU: I just let them inside my latest invention-THE EVO-BOOTH!
NOBOYUKI: It looks like a London Phone Booth to me!
SEION: What about my bloody leg!
WASHU: What are you talkin' about? There's no phonebooths like this on
earth. Hey! What are you doing Mihoshi?(Mihoshi gets in the booth) Get
outta there! (Mihoshi presses a few buttons on the phone) What are you
doing!(The booth lights up for a second and then goes out. The door
opens and smoke billows out. We see that Mihoshi's clothes have
disentergrated and she says..
MIHOSHI: Ouch.
SEION: There's still the problem of my..(see's Mihoshi)..Oh baby. Here
take this and cover yourself up.(he hands her his tiger skin) Are you
alright.
MIHOSHI: I'm perfectly fine, my dear Seion. Although I'm rather
suprised that I wasn't vaporized by the rays from that machine. They
must not effect living things.
KIYONE: Alright, what did that thing do to Mihoshi?
WASHU: It seems to have evolved her exactly 203 years, 8 months, 21
days, 5 hours, 46 minutes, and 54.895768432 seconds! Her IQ went up
about 50 points. But if you want me to switch her back-
KIYONE: No, that's alright.
MIHOSHI: Oh, well. I must be getting ready for work.
KIYONE: Where are you working at now anyway.
MIHOSHI: At a place called a strip club.
KIYONE: Do you know what they do there?
MIHOSHI: Yeah, yeah. I know, but I'm making lots of money showing this
body off!(she flashes everybody. Noboyuki franticly looks for a
camera, Tenchi gets a nosebleed, Sasami giggles, Seion drools, and
Yosho just stands there.) See you later!(she leaves)
KIYONE: Oh no! I've gotta get to the flower shop before 10:00. I'm
gonna be late! I don't have enough time to bathe and catch a train!
NOBOYUKI: Isn't the shop just down the street from here?
KIYONE: I almost forgot. It took a lot longer from the apartment. Can
I get a ride from you?
NOBOYUKI: Sure! I'll be leaving in 40 minutes.
KIYONE:That'll be just enough time! Thank you!(She leaves)
WASHU: Now what's the problem with this leg that Yosho can't fix?
YOSHO: Well, it appears that my medical knowledge doesn't cover
nanotechnology.
WASHU: WOOOHH! Nanotechnology! I was working on a fully nanotech
cyborg before they sent me here. It was almost perfect until it
met..Mihoshi. Rest in peace Mecha-Washu.
SEION: And thanks to your research I am still here. These nanotech
cells heal scars completly.
And they prevent disease and poisons by destroying any harmful
materials in my bloodstream.
TENCHI: What's nanotechnolgy?
WASHU: I'm so glad you asked! Nanotechnolgy involves mass produced,
artificial cells. These include white blood cells, neurons, and repair
cells. It also involves replacing muscle tissue with myomers, joints
with actuators, and reinforcing the entire skeletal structure. It's
much better that the normal way of strapping big, ugly metal limbs to
a flesh and bone body. Now if you will look at the screen here I can
show you more.........
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: Kiyone walks into the bath room when she see's Ryoko and Aeka
holding onto earch other, shaking and frightened.
AEKA: Are..are t-t-the c-c-c-cl-closet-t m-m-monst-t-ters g-g-gone?
RYOKO: C-closet monst-ters? I just want to know if th-those b-b-b-bran
m-m-m-m-muf-fins are still out there!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: Outside of the Masaki shirne. Tenchi and Seion are practicing.
Yosho is watching them.
The radio is playing.
RADIO DJ: It's 11:30 and 85 degrees out there. Here's a new one by
Tomo Sakurai......
(Tenchi takes a swing with his bokken which Seion easily dodges)
SEION: What was that? We need emotional content here. Try it again.
(Tenchi takes another swing and misses again)
SEION: I said with emotion, not anger. Sword fighting is like a finger
pointing towards the heavens-
TENCHI: Will ya knock it off with the Bruce Lee quotes?
SEION: Okay, then try this exercise out! Defend using only you
periferal vision.
TENCHI: But that'll leave me open to attacks from the front!
SEION: 90% of the time a person is hit by an attack he never see's
coming! But if he uses his entire eye then he can prevent these
attacks as well. A warrior must use all of his senses at 100% to be
truly effective. Why do you think your grandpa is so good? Because of
Jurai's power? He'd probably laugh at that too. It's because he is
aware of everything around him. He doesn't just focus on one thing. He
focuses on his surroundings, on his opponents, and on his allies. In
other words, since he doesn't look at the finger, he doesn't miss all
of that heavenly glory.
TENCHI: Is that what Bruce Lee ment when he said that?
YOSHO: Why don't you boys take a break? Sasami will be up with lunch
soon.
RADIO DJ: And now for today's contest! Our next song is by American
pop artist Debbie Gibson called "Butterflies Are Free." She'll be in
concert at Okyama on June 26.
TENCHI: Sasami wants to go to that concert.
RADIO DJ: Four tickets for the fifth caller who can answer this
question. Now we all know that Miss Gibson is an piano virtuoso. What
other rock pianist had the piano teacher?
TENCHI: I know this one! It's Elton John! I gotta get to the phone! 
RADIO: Sorry, your caller #4. Caller five, do you know the answer?
YOSHO: (on the radio) Why, I believe I do, young man. The answer I
believe is Billy Joel.
TENCHI: Oh, no.
RADIO: YOU ARE A WINNER! Stay on the line and I'll tell you where to
pick up the tickets.
TENCHI: Grandpa, how do you know these things?
YOSHO: I do have a life outside of this shrine, you know.
(Sasami comes running up the stairs)
SASAMI: Tenchi! Seion! Grandpa! I got your lunch! 
TENCHI: What did you bring us, Sasami?
SASAMI: Well, I wanted to try something new and so I saw something on
Ranma that Ukyo was making and well.....
TENCHI: Okinomiyaki. Thank you, Sasami. I'm sure it's just as good as
all of the other meals you make for us.
SASAMI: Well, Washu and I are going to the flower shop and see Kiyone!
Bye!(Sasami leaves)
SEION: You really oughta wait for her to grow up and marry her,
Tenchi. A nice girl like her usually comes but once in a lifetime. If
you lose her, you might not get another chance at a girl like that
ever again.
YOSHO: He's got a point, Tenchi. But you don't have to worry about
that now. You still have years before you need to settle down. By the
way, why don't you go to the station later on and pick up those
tickets. I'm sure Sasami will appriciate them.
TENCHI: Thanks, grandpa. Can you give me a ride, Seion?
SEION: Sure, now that I've got that Shelby fixed up. I have to go pick
up Mihoshi anyway. She says she wants to try out something that women
on her planet do for the man they love. All's I know is it involves
acupuncture needles, oil, and incense.
(as Tenchi whatch's Sasami skip down the stairs from the shrine the
radio starts playing....
           Don't close your hand
	     Just close your eyes
	     And I will stay righ by your side
	     And if this world turns cruel and cold
	     Look to the skies
	     Don't you see the truth?
	     The power of one, the power of two
	     The power of me loving you...
	     
           Butterflies are free
	     Free to come and go
	     Free to spead their wing
	     Know that I know
	     You'll come back to me
	     Cause love like butterflies are free
 
	     You see a light
	     You hear a call.........

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Notes:
	1.Before you ask "Why did you choose a 'lame' singer like Debbie
Gibson instead of somebody more popular?" I'll tell you. Debbie Gibson
may not very big over here, but the Japanese people love her. She
regularly tours over there and sells more albums in Japan than she
does the rest of the world. Plus, out of all the singer in America,
her sounds the most like anime music. Her music is closer to the
"Bubblegum Crisis" sound than any alternative rock band, rap group, or
Spice Girls could ever hope to be. Added to the fact that she has
inspires the manga "Pop Fighter," which can be located on the Anime
Web Turpike Fan art Section, I belive she is more appropriate than any
American singer (with the possible exception of Sharron Scott and
Diane Michelle, and if you don't know who they are, you shouldn't even
be here). Quit making references to Anime and alternative rock because
they just don't mix.
	2. Demi was first featured in the Tenchi Muyo comic put out by
Pioneer about March 1997.
She's a cat-like alien who also happens to have a cabbit named Tetin.
The voice I chose for her is Tomo Sakurai, best know for playing
Shayla-Shayla from El-Hazard. If you'd like to see my pictures of Demi
