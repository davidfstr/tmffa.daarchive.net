Tenchi Forever: Never forget us
Chapter1: Heart Ache.
by: Richard "Shin Akuma" Valdez
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Haruna: Tenchi!!! Dinner is ready!

Tenchi: Be there in a few minutes. {tenchi works the carrot fields 
as his beautiful wife, haruna makes bontiful feast with help of the
ever present samsaemi}

Today is kasahito's birthday and all have been
preparing all day for the huge celebration. Little
Achika has a cute smile as her mother feeds fer
and a glow at the warm smile of her father.

Ryoko and Aeka on the other hand...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ryoko: Damn it aeka! what in the hell are you doing in there?!?

Aeka: {crying}

Ryoko: Fine! be a royal wyning pain. I don't give a damn!

[Some time later]

Ryoko: MOM!!! Aeka won't let me use the bathroom {pouting}

{Washu appers next to a pouting ryoko}

Washu: Now Now. what's wrong? Tell mom all about it.

Ryoko: {lightly sobbing} Mom! I've been waiting 2 hours and
aeka won't come out and I really have to go.

Washu: Not a problem for the greatest scietific genuis (and mother)
in the universe!!

{washu pulls up her halopad and stablizes a portal from 
the hall straight into the bathroom}

as ryoko and washu enter they notice a big pile of purple
sobbing tears balled up in the corner. Aeka wouldn't move 
her spot. mother and daughter didn't know what to do.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tenchi: Grandpa is going to love the wonderful feast and celabretion
that we've all prepared for him.

Haruna: I know. I've been working on it all day (favoring her back)
but I know it will be worth it.

Tenchi: Haruna, Go upstairs and rest. you've earned it today. {smiling}

Haruna: Alright. Only beacause I love my tenchi so much. Wake me up
before you decide to yell happy birthday to yosho. {haruna walks up 
the stairs and takes a small rest with thier daughter achika-chan}

[A few minutes later washu come running downstairs to find a blissful tenchi]

Washu: {Huffing and puffing...} Aeka...Mad...Sad...delirious...Crying...

Tenchi: Washu?!? Calm down and tell me (slowly) what is going on.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Some time later as Haruna was waking]:

Tenchi: {Shaking Haruna}Haruna, haruna wake up. I need your help.
There is something wrong with Aeka.

Haruna: {Half asleep and yawning}Tenchi, what do mean if you don't mind?

Tenchi: wahsu and ryoko found Aeka curled in a corner of the
bathroom just crying. nothing else but crying. I don't what to
do. I've never been good at these things. that's why I need you help.

Haruna: {Wraps herself around tenchi's neck} Well help me up
and I'll see what I can do to help matters. We'll send Washu
to watch achika once we get to the washroom.

Tenchi: I think that is a good idea. Washu has a knack for baby sitting.

Haruna: I know. But I also know that you are good too...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{Tenchi and Haruna walk over to the bathroom with a confused mother
and daughter and a very hungry cabbit}

Ryo-Oki: Miya meow

Ryoko: Oh tenchi!!{Lite up eyes} I don't know what's going on.
Aeka won't say anything or move from the corner over there.

Tenchi: Well, is good at these sorts of things. she will know
what to do everyone. and washu...

Washu: Yes tenchi??

Tenchi: Can you go watch achika for us while we tend to aeka??

Washu: alright.{big sweat drop appers} [heads back to tenchi's room]

Haruna: Ok. let me see what the princess here is sobbing a flood over.
[Looks down at Aeka]Aeka. Aeka, it's haruna. What's wrong.

Aeka: [Looks over and just glances over at tenchi. when she see's
him she crys out]TTTTTTTTTTTTEEEEEEENNNNNNNCCCCCCHHHHHHHHIIIIII!!!
{and goes back to crying}

Haruna: Ryoko, Please help me take aeka up to her room. She going to need
some time to herself it looks like. Tenchi go downstairs and help
sasami with dinner. We'll talk later.

Ryoko: I hope this will all blow over.

Tenchi: Nothing in this house ever seems to blow over.

Haruna: It will work itself out. No go help samsamei.

Tenchi: Ok.

[haruna and ryoko help a crying aeka up to her room and set her down
on her bed to rest and vent the rest of the day]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Later before dinner:

Haruna: tenchi, not to insult you, but in way this is somwhat your fault.

Tenchi: [big sweat drop]

Haruna: Don't worry. It's not you directly love.{hugging tenchi}It's just
I've never seen aeka so dpressed before. She still loves you.

Tenchi: I know. But I'm with you and I love you and our daughter. This is
the life I have choosen and I don't want to turn back.

Haruna: She'll have to do this on her own then. Only she can decide to get
better and let go of the past.

tenchi: I hope she can.

[tenchi and haruna kiss as the household come down for a birthday dinner with 
the excrption of aeka]

Nobiyuki: Happy birthday dad!!

Kasahito: Thank you one and all. This will be a great dinner. If you don't
mind though I would like to turn in early tonight after dinner.

Sasamei: It's your day. But that idea sound good for me too.

Ryoko: I'll be up most of the night.{eye balling tenchi}

Tenchi:{jittering}I have to get up early for work in the morning.

Haruna: {staring down ryoko}tenchi needs his rest as do I and achika.

{After dinner tenchi, haruna, and walk upstairs kissing every 5 steps
to thier to lay the family to sleep.}

Washu: I'll turn in now. Tomorrow it's busy busy busy for the greatest
scientific genius in the universe.[yawns]

Mihoshi:{passed out on the couch}

Kiyone: I'll never figure out how she can sleep so much.

Sasamei: Come on Ryo-oki it's time to go to bed.

Ryo-oki:{with beloved carrot}MIYA!!!

[night falls on the masaki house and aeka crys the entire night 
wondering why tenchi would not love her}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That morning:

sasamei: Aeka? Aeka, it's time for breakfast.

aeka: [just shrugs her off snd sleeps]

[sasamei leaves in pout and goes to get dinner ready
before school starts]

Haruna: {turning to tenchi} Tenchi. it's time to go to work
or you'll be late.

tenchi: [groogy]I'm getting up, Just a few minutes. besides
I don't want to miss breakfast.

In ryoko's room;

Ryoko: I wonder the royal brat is doing.

(she sneaks a peak at aeka rooms and see's her crying like before0

Ryoko: I hope she can get better soon. but what happens now...?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
next time on Tenchi forever!!:
tenchi:It's breakfast time and still no aeka.
haruna:The rest of the house is worried and
achika is up.
Mihoshi:Where is my donut??
Kiyone:Mihoshi you are hopeless.
Mihosi:WWWWWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!
Washu:Aeka will then have to make an life changing decision.
tenchi:next time on chapter3: sunday mornings
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Somw after thoughts:
You know there are not too many haruna fics out there and I wanted to see what 
would happen if tenchi stayed true to haruna. And also how the others would
react after such a marrige. as you can see ryoko still tries to seduce tenchi
and aeka just seems to break down. Well hope you like and we'll see what happens
the next day.

comments are welcome so send em too shinakuma@planetjurai.com 
You just have to love haruna.
