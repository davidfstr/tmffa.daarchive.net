Kiyone

It cannot hurt
For I cannot feel
Not anymore
They would care for me
Why?
I don't wish it
I don't want it
To care, they would have to know
To know, they would have to care
No one can know
So, no one can care
And that's the way I wish it to be
But what if I should care
What if she could care
What then
Could she know
Could she care...

Washuu's lab

Washuu lay back in her chair and tried to look very competent (not very easy in her child form). 

Kiyone sighed deeply and closed her eyes. She knew this day would come, she couldn't hold it to 
herself forever. <Oh, I wish I could...>

"All right Mrs. Makibi, I want you to tell me about your past, and don't leave anything out. 
Remember, I'm here to help you."

Kiyone sighed again and took a deep breath, "All right...my past..."

<<<
Kiyone's past
>>>

"So, you the lesbo?"

A young girl with deep teal hair and a red headband stood trembling against a brick wall. In front 
of her, three older girls stood smirking down at her. 

The middle one barked out, "Answer me, you dumb dyke!"

The teal haired girl shrugged nervously. "I-I don't know what you m-mean..."

The middle girl's smirk turned evil, "I mean, do you like girls?"

She nodded shakily, "I-I guess so...I don't really have any f-friends but-"

"That's not what I mean dyke!" She yelled, "I mean do you like to fuck them?!?"

The teal haired girl quickly shook her head, "N-n-no! I...n-never..."

The smirk now turned to a sneer, "I don't believe you!" 

Luckily for her, a teacher had been standing by and heard most of the conversation. "Mitsuki! I 
can't believe you would use that kind of language! Not only that, but to suggest that Kiyone here 
is a...well you know, it's just wrong! I'll see you in detention!" She turned to the quivering Kiyone, 
"You may go to class now, Kiyone. They won't bother you anymore." She turned back up to 
Mitsuki and her two lackeys, "Isn't that right?"

Mitsuki tried to plead, "But she was looking at us in the dressing room and-"

"Not another word!" She gestured towards the principal's office, "Now!"

They grumbled as they made their way to the office, giving Kiyone one last threatening glare. 
Kiyone waited till they went in, then she took of towards her class, to which she was already late.

<<<>>>

Kiyone sat down, holding her self-made dinner. She didn't mind making dinner that much, but she 
only knew one recipe and she had soon gotten tired of it. The only light that filled the room was 
that of a single white candle that didn't look like it would last that much longer. <I should probably 
get another one tomorrow, after school.> Kiyone thought to herself. They couldn't afford lighting 
anymore because of her mom's 'habit'. Kiyone visibly shuddered, remembering that this time of 
the month, her mom was all out, and she needed some _other_ ways of pleasing. She pulled her 
jacket closer around her, praying that her mom had already fallen asleep tonight. 

"Hopefully..."

She sat still in her rickety wooden chair. She had suddenly lost her distaste for food. The feeling 
in her stomach now was more of a sheer dread of what was to come (no pun intended). 

*Click*

The sound of her mother's high heels shattered all hope. 

*Click* *Click*

She knew then and there, there was no way out. 

*Click* *Click* 

She dropped her jacket to the floor. She started to unbutton her blouse when she felt her 
mother's hand on her shoulder.

"You know what day it is?"

Kiyone nodded her head solemnly. "Yes..." She whispered.

"Good." 

She turned to face her mother. Her face, once young and beautiful was now scarred with wrinkles 
and deep rings around her eyes. You could clearly see the veins in her skin, and there was an 
obvious balding on her forehead. Kiyone unbuttoned her blouse the rest of the way and let it drop 
to the floor. She shuddered as she felt the cool breeze rush over her naked chest. Tears began to 
flood her eyes but she simply wiped them away and took her mother's hand, as they walked into 
the bedroom and shut the door.

All night long, heavy crying could be heard echoing all over the neighborhood.

<<<>>>

The next day , Kiyone woke up to the sounds of hard knocking on the door. She knew her mom 
would never get up to get it so she quickly slipped on some pajamas and got out of bed, trying 
hard not to wake up her sleeping mother. She ran to the door and opened it slowly, so her eyes 
could adjust to the blinding morning light, but when she could see, she was shocked. Before her 
stood a tall slender woman dressed in standard GP uniform with long deep green tresses.

The woman spoke, "Hi, my name's officer Kei Masunari. Are you, Kiyone Makibi?" 

Kiyone shook her head dumbly, "Are you here to...take my mom away?" 

The officer almost smiled at this question, "Well that all depends," She kneeled down to face 
Kiyone in the eyes, taking away some of her overwhelming intimidation. Her deep green tresses 
seemed to flow over her shoulders. "Kiyone, we'd like to ask you a few questions. First of all, can 
I come in?"

Kiyone thought carefully for a minute, then nodded. "Sure, but hold on a minute." She 
disappeared for a second, then came back with a candle in her hand. "C'mon in." She grabbed 
the officer's hand and led her into the house and to the dining room, where her blouse and jacket 
were still lying, though among the other litter in the room, they took no note of it. They sat down 
and stayed silent for a minute. The uncomfortable silence hung in the air like a piercing dread. 
Kiyone knew what was to happen, just like last night, in this very same room, but she could do 
nothing to stop it.

Kei finally spoke up, "Kiyone, does your mother...touch you in a sexual way?"

Kiyone's breath caught in her throat, "Y-yes...she does." She felt tears form in her eyes, she felt 
like she had done something wrong all of the sudden.

Kei lowered her head a bit, she felt her blood run cold with that answer. She was hoping this was 
all a misunderstanding, but it seemed she wouldn't be so lucky. "Do you ever tell her to...stop?"

Kiyone nodded as tears began a steady stream down her face. "Yes, all the time."

Kei sighed dejectedly, "Kiyone, I'm afraid-"

Kiyone fell to the floor, holding her face in her hands, "I-I'm so s-sorry...I didn't want to be a l-
lesbian, I-I...sh-she made me!" She started to sob loudly.

Kei ran to her side, holding her closely. "No, no, no. Kiyone, you aren't a lesbian, she made you 
do those things. Look at me." 

Kiyone responded instantly to her soft, soothing voice. She looked up into her eyes, she felt 
comfort there, comfort she could never find in her mother. 

"You aren't a lesbian. She can't make you one. What she did to you was wrong and you are 
_not_ to blame for it...do you understand?" 

Kiyone, still sobbing, nodded anxiously. "Yes. Th-thank you Mrs. Masunari. C-can you take my 
mom away now?"

Kei smiled warmly, "Yes, if that's what you want."

Kiyone nodded eagerly. "Y-yes, please..."

"So, Mrs. Masunari, where will I live now?"

"I don't know...where do you want to live."

"I...I want to live with you..."

"What?!?"

"Yeah, you're so nice...and I like you."

"Oh, well, I guess it wouldn't hurt. For a while."

"Yay! Oh, and Mrs. Masunari, c-can I call you mommy?"

Kei smiled happily, she was on the verge of crying. "Y-yes, you can"

"Thank you"

<<<>>>

The next day at school, during lunch, Kiyone sat alone. The whole school knew, and now they 
had every reason to call her a lesbian. She didn't care though, she knew the truth and that was 
enough for her. But she was kind of lonely. Fortunately for her, there was a new girl at school, 
and hopefully, she would be the only one that didn't know. I wasn't looking that way though.

"Hey dyke!" She heard from behind her. She didn't need to turn around, she knew who it was.

"Hello Mitsuki." 

"I heard what happened to you. I can guess that you enjoyed it too." Kiyone could almost hear the 
smirk on her face.

"Then you can guess whatever you want, I don't care..." 

Mitsuki grabbed her and turned her around. "I'll bet you'll start to care with my fist in you mouth!"

Kiyone looked at her solemnly, "Not really...I know the truth, and I don't care what you think is the 
truth." Kiyone grabbed her hand and in one swift movement twisted it around her to back, not 
enough to break it, but enough to get her attention. "I learned that from my new mom." She 
whispered into her ear. 

"Hi, I'm Mihoshi!"

Both girls turned they're heads to the smiling blonde, who seemed oblivious to the whole 
situation. 

"Uh, hi...Mihoshi." Kiyone said, her face a bundle of confusion. 

"Hi! You must be Kiyone. What'cha doin'?" 

Kiyone sighed, then the new girl had heard of what happened. "Nothing really." She let Mitsuki 
go, who then ran as fast as she could, saying something about 'dykes and testosterone'. 

Mihoshi looked at her quizzically, "Oh, you mind if I sit here?"

Kiyone nodded her head, actually surprised someone wasn't disgusted at her very presence. "S-
sure you can, if you want to."

The grinning blonde plopped down happily, then began eating. By then the attention on her was 
gone. Kiyone was happy about at least that. Mihoshi looked at her quizzically. "Oh, yeah, why did 
they say you were...well that?" Mihoshi asked. 

Kiyone sighed in relief. <So she hasn't heard.> "Oh, no real reason. So, where you from?"

<Hmm...> Mihoshi thought. <Maybe it's because her mom raped her...> 

***
Washuu's lab
***

Washuu put down her pen and took a deep breath. "Well I guess that's all for today, Mrs. Makibi."

Kiyone wiped her eyes and sat up, "Oh...how long has it been?"

Washuu looked at her watch and said plainly, "Three hours."

Kiyone's eyes grew wide. "Three hours?!? I left Mihoshi alone for three hours?!?"

"Don't worry, Ryoko was taking care of her, but I do have a little more to say to you." Washuu 
lifted up her notepad. "I think I've found your problem."

"W-what problem?!?", Kiyone almost sputtered out. 

"Nothing much, just your relationship with Mihoshi..." Washuu said offhandedly.

"What do you mean, 'relationship'?!?" Kiyone screamed.

Washuu rolled her eyes. "Oh, please Kiyone. We all could sense that something is going on with 
you two. You've been off of the norm all week. But I think I know why." Kiyone sat down heavily 
and took a deep breath. "First of all, is there anything either of you said or did that you should 
probably should tell me about."

Kiyone lay back again. "Well, once, when she was asleep, I-I heard her talking, and she said 
something..."

This perked Washuu's attention. "Oh, she did? What'd she say?"

Kiyone felt cold sweat roll down her back. "Sh-she said that she...loves me."

"Hmmm...She did. And what did you do?" Washuu asked slyly with almost a twinge of enjoyment 
in her voice.

"N-nothing...I haven't said or done anything about it." 

Washuu's eyebrows shot up. "Oh...then what do you feel about it?"

Kiyone began to shift around in her seat uncomfortably. "I-I don't know, really. Thinking about it 
makes me feel...well...uncomfortable."

Washuu thought deeply about this. "Hmm, I see. Could it be, Kiyone, that perhaps you're feel 
guilty about your own feelings."

Kiyone sat up straight and sputtered out, "W-what?!? What feelings?!?!? I-I don't feel that way!!! 
Why would I-"

Washuu began to chuckle at her reaction.

"What?!? What's so funny?!?" 

Washuu sat up straight, trying to make herself look important. "It's just your reaction to the 
thought of you feeling that way...towards another woman."

"But I don't!!!"

"Yes, it's quite possible that you don't, but it's also possible that you do." Washuu took down a 
few quick notes before continuing. "I think, Kiyone, that because of your experience with 
lesbianism, probably the worst kind of experience possible, that now you feel that that type of 
thing is...well, wrong and perhaps the thought of you feeling that way has made you feel a bit 
guilty. Tell me, how did you feel about Mihoshi before you found out about her feelings?"

Kiyone, now looking a bit shocked by Washuu's bluntness, took a moments thought before 
answering. "I-I felt like she was like a little sister...or something. Like I felt responsible for her, but 
at the same time feeling fo-" She stopped in sudden realization. Her eyes grew wide with fear.

Washuu asked slyly, "Feeling what?"

"Feeling for her deeply..." 

"Oh..."

Kiyone sat in thoughtful silence for a moment, before breaking into uncontrollable tears. Washuu 
jumped to her side, holding her in a comforting embrace. "Shhhh...It's okay, Kiyone. It's nothing to 
be ashamed of."

"N-no...it can't be...I'm not like that. IT CAN'T BE!!!" She threw Washuu away from her. She fell to 
the floor holding her face in her hands.

Washuu got up dusting herself off. "Fine then, why do you have to convince yourself?"

Kiyone looked up, eyes full of searing hate. "Shut up! You don't know how I feel! You could never 
know."

Washuu sighed. "Your right, I couldn't...but I do know what it's like to be alone, and it's what 
Mihoshi is feeling right now. And whether you feel the same way or not, leaving her guessing like 
this is killing her...slowly. That's cruel Kiyone. Now, if you don't feel the same, you should at least 
tell her, and prove it to yourself. But otherwise, you truly need to tell her...and yourself."

"I-I don't know if I...can."

Washuu sighed exasperatedly, "Kiyone, let me tell you something. What you mother did was 
wrong...do you understand? Wrong. But lesbianism is not, it's a completely normal feeling that 
some women just...have. If you are a lesbian, there is nothing to be ashamed of. It just proves 
how pure true love is. Look, if two people love each other, with no chance of procreation or 
expectance in any society, that is true love."

Kiyone looked up to Washuu, she now seemed just a bit more impressive. She smiled lightly. 
"You're right, Washuu. I-I have someone to talk to."

Washuu also smiled, "I understand. You can go now."

As if on queue, a door appeared from nowhere. Its very presence seemed to mean something to 
Kiyone. She smiled and lifted herself from the floor. "Goodbye, Mrs. Washuu."

"..."

"_Little_ Washuu. Thanks for everything." She stepped out the door to face an event that would 
change her life forever..."
