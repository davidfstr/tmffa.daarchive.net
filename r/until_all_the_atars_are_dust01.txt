Tenchi Muyo! and its various characters are the property of AIC and Pioneer.
  I do not own them, nor would I ever want to.  I mean, could you imagine
the amount of money it would take to repair my house after one of Ryoko and
Aeyeka's little arguments?  Not to mention the fact that I'd have half the
galaxies most demented (and colorful)  psychopaths descending on my roof
every few weeks to do battle with Tenchi for who knows why.  Sheesh.
Anyway, a few of these characters are of my own creation, but I don't think
I need to list them, as you'll probably spot them on your own.
        One note before you read:  I know the movie Tenchi Muyo in Love is
based
off the TV series.  However, I have chosen to take the majority of my
continuity from the original OAVs for various reasons that should become
evident as the story progresses.
        Enjoy.

UNTIL ALL THE STARS ARE DUST: THE HISTORY OF KAIN
Part 1

All great moments happen in a wash of tears. The mother cries tears of
happiness and pain as her child is brought into the world. Tears of pride
spill from the general's eyes as he watches his well-trained men subdue an
invading enemy.  The revolutionary sheds tears of joy as the constitution is
signed for his newborn country.  And of course, the wife weeps a sea of
tears as her lover dies.
        Yet, these are not the ordinary tears that are shed nearly every
day.  No-
these are the True tears, the essence of passion.  These tears come straight
from the heart.  They do not merely shimmer- but glow silver, bright as
moonlight, as they spill down the face.
        These tears are the milestones of the universe.  They mark the end
of an
existence which was truly momentous, or sometimes they portend an even
greater existence yet to come...
Aganoto, a rather eccentric Juraian philosopher-poet of the early Onizano
Era

It is believed by numerous peoples, that Time is not a river, but a Wheel.
Instead of flowing on into eternity, Time cycles through various periods,
often known as Ages, eventually arriving back where it started to begin the
cycle anew.  Each Age is distinct from those that have come before it in
some way, though it is often difficult to tell just how.
Additionally, it is believed that with the arrival of each Age, there comes
a "refinement" of the elemental forces that make up the universe.  Metal,
Fire, Water, Air, Wood, Light, Dark- EVERYTHING gradually becomes more and
more distinct and idealized: a purer form of its fundamental force.
According to this theory, even the Gods themselves undergo refinement...
-excerpt from " The Radiant Mandate: a discussion of the various religions
throughout the galaxy.  Vol. IX", by Nutaro Hiyato, Royal Chronicler of
Jurai.

The First Age...

Tears flashed silver across his cheek as he ran through the forest. A second
liquid, much darker and thicker than simple tears, trickled from the tip of
the yellow-glowing dagger in his hand.  Overhead, the full moon seemed to be
a dead, baleful eye glaring down upon him.
He could still hear the screams of women and the shouts of outraged guards
emanating from the Royal Palace far behind him.  Already tiny pinpricks of
torchlight were beginning to stream down from the fortified hill as the
entire garrison of House Jurai took chase.
Pain filled his mind.  But it was not the simple, physical pain from the
sharp brambles that bit at his face and tore his kimono.  No, it was a
much-deeper pain, throbbing from the very core of his being.  Pain for the
loved ones he had lost in the hostile takeover of his village.  Pain for his
father's forced induction into the cruel labor force of the invading
Juraians.  Pain for the old man's subsequent death in a gas explosion in the
underground mines.   Pain for the annexing of his beloved country of
Midaniya into the ever-growing monster that was Jurai.

***Since the beginning It had lain below.  Deep down, within the oldest
roots of the oldest trees. Trees that had long ago rotted away, leaving only
their desiccated, iron-tough supports.  Down there it was trapped, where
other plants could not reach.  Down where the constant pressure of a dozen
feet of marshy soil had pressed It to a state of immobility.  Where Its
thick, oily skin merged with the brackish water that had not felt the ruby
hues of a sunrise for millennia***

It had taken him two years to exact his revenge.
During the intervening period, he had plotted and prepared, making ready for
the fateful day.
Then at last it had come.  The majority of the Juraian military had been
away on campaign for yet another conquest.  Only a little over forty men had
remained at the imperial palace.  The emperor was so far from enemy lines,
and so smug in his power, that he had believed no one could get into his
abode unseen.
The emperor had been wrong.

***It was not a living thing, even under the grossest perversions of the
word.  It had no intelligence, no metabolism, no instincts.  It simply
existed: a rudimentary elemental force, locked far beneath the fermenting
peat.
Yet, like all elements, It would react under the proper conditions.  Though
air, fresh water and living creatures could not penetrate this far down,
something else could: raw emotion.
Many times It had twitched as some being, caught in the grips of highest
passion, passed by overhead.  Though the passions gave It a brief bit of
movement, they were never strong enough to cause any lasting animation.
Until now.
Something was drawing near.  An emotion of such intensity that it pierced
all the way through the layers of peat to strike like a ray of purest
sunshine.
It began to stir.***

The deed had been done with an unbelievable swiftness.  The castle had not
been well guarded.
The outer rooms had been a cinch to navigate, and once within the heart of
the mansion, he had easily hid from the watchmen.  Approaching the innermost
chamber with a blazing yellow light-dagger held at the ready, he'd ripped
aside the sliding paper door.   Not caring if he was caught, he'd leapt upon
the sleeping form of the emperor.  The weapon had painted a bright arc of
cold amber light across the darkness.  There had been a brief gasp, then a
muffled shriek.
        Then it was over.  The Juraian emperor was dead.
        In a fit of instinct, he had run, tearing through the palace as fast
as his
legs would carry him.  Out into the cool air of the night he ran, beneath
the boughs of the beautiful sacred shinboku trees that dotted the terraced
hill.
        Now he was loping through the woods, completely heedless of the
world
around him. He stopped as his foot sunk into the ground.  Cold water rushed
all the way up his calf, staining his kimono.
        Looking up, he saw that the trees were now draped with great dark
cloaks of
moss.  Innumerable tiny frogs chirruped unseen in the bush.  The moon was
almost lost beneath a thousand dripping vines.  He had inadvertently run
into the swamp.
        Behind him, he could still hear the distant shouts of soldiers.

*** An irresistible magnetism drew It forth from the peat.  With the slow,
unstoppable speed of an elemental force, It oozed Its way through the
soil.***

He hated the Juraians, hated them with all his heart.  They had taken his
whole life away from him, all in a petty squabble over land.  The
destruction of their monstrous emperor was not enough; he would kill all of
them.
He stopped suddenly as the trees opened up around him, revealing a clearing.
  The pristine beauty of the scene brought a momentary wisp of calm to his
rage-blackened mind.
Before him stood a vast expanse of pure, open water.  The ivory eye of the
moon reflected calmly upon its surface, indifferent to the drama that was
taking place below it.  Tiny threads of dark metal, dragonflies perhaps,
buzzed here and there upon the mirrored surface.  The tall, misshapen trees,
black against the night sky, rose to form a high wall all along the outer
rim of the pool.  Though he could not see the bottom, he knew it must go
down for hundreds of feet.  In the center rose a gnarled, ancient tree, its
dead branches clutching towards the sky like the hand of a drowning man.
There was an agelessness to this place, a detachment from reality and the
worries of men and beasts.  The world could go on raging all about it, but
this one spot would remain forever unchanged.
Even as a boy, he'd learned to love and show respect for those things in
life that possessed such beauty.  Unconsciously, he began to utter a
whispered prayer of reverence to the magnificent kami that must certainly
inhabit this clandestine little realm.
His reverie shattered as the sound of shouts and muted footfalls came to him
upon the cold, humid breeze.  Damn! The Juraians were coming!  He could not
run any more.  He would simply have to turn and face them.  As he whirled
around for his final stand, a hot white whip of absolute hatred burned in
his mind.

***The peat opened up and It was in open water.  The drawing force was
close***

A vague tingling caused the hair on the back of his neck to prick up. The
air grew slightly warmer.
His mind continued to rage: hate. hate.hate!

***Closer***

He cocked his head over his shoulder.  There had been a faint noise in the
pool, like the sound of something swimming below the surface.
Still the burning scarlet clouded his eyes: He would kill ALL Juraians!

***Closer***

His eyes strained to look within the depths.  Something was moving down
there.

***RELEASE!!!***

The water erupted before him.  A mass of black, oily ropes- like darkness
given substance- rushed up and struck him.  He had no time to scream as the
heavy mass oozed all over him, covering him in a slick mantle of jet.  His
legs gave out and he fell into the water.  The yellow dagger flickered and
died away in his hand.
Down he plunged, sinking into the depths.  His mind had little time to
register terror as he was quickly dissolved and absorbed into the mass.
Though his brain and body were quickly destroyed, his brief contact with the
thing had left its mark.  The blackness was no longer just an elemental
force.  Connection with the unfortunate being had "taught" It how to live.
Its molecules followed the pattern of the organism It had devoured, creating
something not unlike a rudimentary mentality.
The hatred too, had had its effect.   The negative force of Its essence had
readily latched onto this consuming passion, twisting and shaping the
developing consciousness to conform to the emotions that had originally
drawn it forth.

The royal garrison of Jurai burst into the clearing, lightswords blazing
bright like witch-fire.  They stood perplexed for a moment, wondering where
their quarry had gone.
Then, for the second time that night, the pool burst in a tremendous arc of
broken moonlight.  Foul, bitter water soaked the guardsmen, drenching their
clothes and choking their lungs with its brackish taste.
One by one, their gazes were drawn upward, pulled by some alien force.  And
one by one, they saw the image of their attacker, and were filled with
animal terror.
  A ragged teardrop of purest obsidian hovered above the men, driving them
to their knees with its fell aura.  A single piercing scream issued from
somewhere within It:
"JURAI!!!!!!!!"
