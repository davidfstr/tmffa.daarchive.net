Kiyone stepped out of the light and found herself in an empty carrot field. She looked around, 
somewhat confused about her surroundings. <What's going on...where's Mihoshi?>, She thought. 
She cupped her hands around to her mouth. "Mihoshi?" She shouted, "Are you here?" The only 
answer she got was the soft wind in the blowing by her, picking up her hair and making it flow like 
a soft, teal river. She couldn't help but smile at the beauty in her surroundings, it was mid-fall and 
the countryside was decorated in patterns of yellow, red, orange and brown. "Mihoshi?" She 
called again. Still no answer...

Suddenly, she felt a strange green aura envelope her. She let it lift her gently from the ground as 
she floated towards a familiar hum. <What's going on?> She thought to herself.

Mihoshi

"You sure you want to do this, Mihoshi?"

"Absolutely..."

"But what if she doesn't feel the same way towards you?"

Mihoshi sighed placidly. "I can live with that...but I can't live with not knowing."

A small, admiring sigh escaped Sasami's mouth. "I hope I grow up to be like you Mihoshi, you're 
so strong."

Mihoshi smiled and hugged Sasami for all she was worth. "Thanks, Sasami. That's sweet of you 
to say."

Sasami hugged back. "You're welcome, Mihoshi." She let go and took one last look at Mihoshi. 
She blushed slightly. "You look great, Mihoshi. Now go on, she's waiting for you."

Mihoshi giggled and headed outside, towards the carrot field.

Sasami sighed and watched her go. "So strong..."

Kiyone found herself in a large, empty room. Not like Washuu's, which seemed to have no end, 
this room had jagged metallic walls. Behind her, Kiyone could see a queen-sized bed with red, 
silk sheets. Kiyone called out, "Mihoshi? Mihoshi, are you in here?" 

No answer came.

Kiyone sighed deeply and plopped down on the bed. It gave way perfectly to fit her. <What am I 
doing here? Where is Mihoshi?> Kiyone shouted out with anger, "Damnit, Mihoshi, where the hell 
are you!?!"

"I'm right here, Kiyone..."

Kiyone's eyes shot up to the source of the sound. Kiyone's mouth hung open in awe. Before her, 
stood one of the most daunting sights of her life. "M-Mihoshi?"

Mihoshi was wearing a long black kimono, decorated with little golden stars. But what first caught 
Kiyone's eyes was her hair. Instead of having it up in that little ribbon she always wore, she had 
let it flow down over shoulders, like a cascading waterfall of gold. Mihoshi smiled pleasantly. But 
there was more to the smile than usual. "Yes, Kiyone?" Kiyone was bewildered at the sound of 
her voice, it wasn't her normal, high-pitched voice, and there was a great deal of...maturity in it. 

"I-I...w-what are we doing in here? W-where are we?" Kiyone managed to stammer out.

Mihoshi's smile broadened. "Why Kiyone, you should be able to figure that out...a good detective 
like you."

Now that she mentioned it, the surroundings did seem a little familiar. And the way she was 
carried up, "Ryo-Oki..."

Mihoshi giggled, she nodded. "That's right."

Kiyone shook her head. "B-but what are we doing in here?"

Mihoshi took a step forward. Kiyone took an instinctive step back. "Well...I have something to say 
to you, Kiyone."

Kiyone swallowed hard. "W-well, you know you can t-tell me anything, M-Mihoshi." She forced a 
smile. 

Mihoshi grinned in response. "I know, Kiyone. That's why I trust you." 

Kiyone found she had backed up a bit too far, and now she was pressing against the wall. 
Mihoshi giggled at her and stepped closer and closer. Kiyone rubbed the back of her head 
nervously. "S-so, what do you want to say to me?"

Mihoshi was now only inches from her face. "I want to say...th-that you're free, Kiyone." Mihoshi 
looked away in shame. "You're free..."

Kiyone looked stunned, "W-what do you-"

Mihoshi beat her to it, "You're free, from me...I won't keep you with me anymore. I sent 
headquarters a partner change request. By tomorrow...you won't have to see me ever again." A 
clearly visible tear rolled down her face. 

Kiyone reached up to wipe it away but Mihoshi pushed her hand away. Kiyone look quizzically at 
her. "B-but why, Mihoshi. Why would you do this?"

Mihoshi looked up and forced a smile onto her face. "Because...I love you Kiyone. A-and I just 
want to make you happy. I-I know now, that you can't be happy with me...so, I'm letting you go."

Kiyone's heart softened upon hearing this. She smiled warmly. "Mihoshi..." She again reached up 
to her face. Mihoshi didn't fight back this time. Kiyone rubbed her face gently. 

Mihoshi's face seemed to contort in pain, she backed away quickly. "Please...Kiyone, don't...I-I 
can't take it..." Tears rolled down her cheeks in small rivers, soaking her dress. "Please...just 
leave..." Mihoshi tried to walk away, but she felt a strong pair of arms grab her shoulders. She 
tried to shrug them off, but the arms wouldn’t let go.

"Mihoshi...don't leave me." Kiyone turned her around and faced her fully. Her eyes were full of 
gleaming sincerity.

Mihoshi stared at her, confused. "B-but I thought-"

"Shhh..." She was silenced by Kiyone's finger. "Please let me explain, Mihoshi."

Mihoshi was still confused, but nodded eagerly.

Kiyone smiled. "Mihoshi, do you remember when you first met me?"

Mihoshi nodded again, her face now full of nostalgic joy. "Of course, Kiyone. Back when we were 
about eight years old I think. You were so cute then!" Mihoshi smiled pleasantly. But it soon 
turned into a wounded frown. "Th-that was right after you mother...did that to you, wasn't it?"

Kiyone looked up in shock. "Y-you knew? A-and you still..."

Mihoshi nodded and smiled warmly. "Liked you? Of course. It wasn't your fault Kiyone. Besides, it 
seemed like you needed a friend at the time." Mihoshi's smile broadened. "I guess I fell in love 
with you back then."

Kiyone smiled, her face stained deeply with tears of joy. "Oh Kami-sama, Mihoshi" She grabbed 
Mihoshi and hugged her deeply. "I-I knew you'd *sniff* understand.."

Mihoshi blushed deeply at the contact. She lifted Kiyone's head, so their eyes could meet. "I-Is 
that why..."

Kiyone nodded. "Yes. I was too caught up in the past to see my feelings for you..."

Mihoshi looked away in shame.

"But..."

The blonde detective's eyes popped open. "But what?" She shouted anxiously.

Kiyone smiled. "But I'm okay...now" She pulled Mihoshi into a long, passionate kiss. 

Mihoshi's breath caught in her throat, her eyes were now flooded with tears. She grabbed Kiyone 
around the shoulders and pulled her in closer. She moaned audibly. Her heart burned with 
emotion. Her mind flooded with questions. But she was too lost now to care. After what seemed 
like an eternity, the two separated with an audible *smack*. Mihoshi looked at her partner through 
teary eyes. "D-does this mean..?"

Kiyone nodded. She held Mihoshi's warm cheek in her palm. "Yes." She closed her eyes and 
took a deep breath. "I love you, Mihoshi."

Mihoshi gasped. She broke into uncontrollable tears, her knees felt weak. She began to wobble 
about. 

Kiyone caught her in her arms. Tears now forming in her own eyes. She and Mihoshi moved 
slowly to their knees, Kiyone never took her eyes off those of her partner. She moved her head 
forward and kissed away her tears. "Please, Mihoshi...don't cry."

Mihoshi gave a small smile but her eyes were still flooded with tears. "I-I can't help it...I'm just  so 
happy." She buried her face in Kiyone's neck. "Y-you don't know how long I *sniff* waited for you 
Kiyone."

Kiyone shook her head slowly. "No...I don't. But I'm sorry...I'd take it all back if I could. All the 
horrible things I've ever said to you...I never meant them. I'm so sorry."

Mihoshi looked Kiyone in the eyes. Her pupils pierced deep into the recesses of Kiyone's soul. "I 
know, Kiyone...I know." 

She pulled her partner's face to her again. The kiss was gentle yet breathtaking. It was something 
they would feel together for the rest of their lives, with every breath they would take, with every 
word they would speak, and beyond that...Forevermore...
